Basically, the lower a unique class score multiplier is, the stronger it is;
however, it reflects strength assuming you know how to properly use this class's abilities.
There are classes that have low score multiplier but are very gimmicky, so they're
probably going to be unreasonably difficult for beginners.
Here, the approximate ease of use for unique classes is expressed with * through *****.
(* - hard to use, ***** - easy to use)

That being said, that's only for clearing dungeon level 100 of Angband; proceeding into
postgame isn't taken into account.


* Regular Protagonists

Reimu               ****

Power depends on amount of money in donation box; any money donated on earlier attempts
will get carried over if you start a new character from the same save file. Weak at the
beginning, but if you keep trying enough, early game eventually will become a breeze.


Marisa              ****

It requires some knowledge to use your powers to full extent, but she's strong enough to
push through with brute force. Good for getting training in playing spellcasters.


* Embodiment of Scarlet Devil

Rumia               **

Comparatively decent in early game, but has trouble past midgame.


Cirno               **

Has low base stats, and all of her special abilities are cold-themed. Oriented to
those who understand gameplay systems and can raise their characters strategically.


Meiling             ***

Focused on martial art combat, so equipment restrictions are fairly strict. Has high
potential, but requires a somewhat unique approach.


Patchouli           ***

Can study all four realms of Arcane Arts, but is frail and has asthma. For intermediate
players that are used to playing mages and know monster parameters in general.


Sakuya              ***

A special class that can freely walk through dungeon while time is stopped. Requires
a somewhat technical approach to combat. Strict equipment restriction (maid uniform only).


Remilia             *****

Her race has a lot of weaknesses, but her base stats are high enough to forget about
that. Just be careful around holy attacks. Somewhat weaker during daytime, so stay until
the night at the inn before heading out.


Flandre             ****

Great stats, great resistances, powerful special abilities; she's strong, but she
has nasty gimmicks as well. She's a berserker magical girl that can occasionally disenchant
her weapon or accidentally break her magic devices and spellbooks.


* Perfect Cherry Blossom

Letty               **

Specializes in cold and sleep inducing attacks; strong against living beings, but has
a hard time dealing with non-living enemies. Early game is doable, but it will get tough
later on.


Chen                ***

Surprisingly strong until you get hit by water. Focuses on martial art combat, so equipment
restrictions are fairly strict. Her shikigami power will vanish if she gets hit by
water; you can recover it by visiting your exploration base.


Alice               *

She lets her dolls wield weapons instead of using them herself; she's a glass cannon
character with several special mechanics. Strong if properly used, but is very gimmicky.
Not recommended for beginners.


Lily White          *

She's not only weak, but you'll get a game over if you spend over 30 game days.
A challenge class for pros.


Prismriver Sisters  ***

Unlike Three Fairies of Light, you're controlling them one at a time. It's a class
that can perform 'job change', so to speak, but it's difficult to use unless you have
enough experience playing various classes. They're ghosts, and their ability to pass
through walls is useful.


Youmu               ****

Starts the game with powerful weapons. Dual-wielding penalty is high on low levels,
so start off using only one of your blades.


Yuyuko              ****

A powerful class that's good both at close combat and using magic, and also can pass
through walls. Damage output is a bit low, and you get hungry faster than usual.


Ran                 *

Very strong, but you get a game over unless you win in 7 in-game days. 
Speedrun challenge class for pros.


Yukari              **

Very strong, but you won't use her to full potentially unless you're maniacally
aware of inner game workings (there's fair amount of Hengband players like that).


* Imperishable Night

Wriggle             **

Lacking both in base stats and special abilities. While she doesn't have any critical
weak points, that's still a class for intermediate players who want to play a weak character.


Mystia              **

She seems to be a bard, but actually she's closer to an assassin-like class.
Can't say she's easy to use.


Keine               ****

Pretty flexible class with excellent parameters and special abilities.
At night on days 15, 45, 75... you grow horns, which automatically removes any helmet
you might be wearing, so be careful.


Tewi                ****

Starts out with $1,000,000; early game will be fun in its own unique way.
While you can buy your way out of early game, going past midgame will be tough.


Udonge              ****

An easy to use class with fairly high parameters and skill levels, and excellent
special abilities. You can power yourself up three times with Grand Patriot Elixir,
but you should stop at that point.


Eirin               *

A NPC Kaguya always stays with you, so you have to fight while protecting her.
For people tired of standard gameplay.


Kaguya              ***

Isn't that strong in early game, but can demonstrate her true power once you clear
the base game.


Mokou               ****

A rule-breaking class; she's not that strong, but she can resurrect by using up MP
upon being defeated. Keep around 50-100 MP to stay on the safe side. Watch out for
monsters that drain MP.


* Phantsmagoria of Flower View

Medicine            ***

Class with a special race that gains experience depending on value of equipped
items. Has abilities related to poison. Gimmicky and not recommended for beginners.


Yuuka               *****

Borderline cheat tier class; she's both strong and starts out with an extremely
powerful weapon. You'll be able to deal with most enemies by running into them.


Komachi             ****

A robust class with high endurance and most of vital early game resistances
covered from the start.


Eiki                *****

An easy to use class; she's resilient to status abnormalities and has many 
excellent special abilities. The power of her fixed weapon is hard to estimate
at first glance, but it's actually top tier.


* Mountain of Faith

Shizuha             *

Martial art class. Her racial abilities can change during gameplay (stray god
feature), so she might end up being strong in endgame, but otherwise she's weak.


Minoriko            **

Dual class. Her racial abilities can change during gameplay (stray god feature), 
so she might end up being strong in endgame, but otherwise she's weak.


Hina                *

A special class with risky combat style utilizing cursed items. Not suited for
beginners at all.


Nitori              ***

Engineer class with some tweaks added. Fights by paying Engineers Guild to get
weapons and supplies. Requires spare time, but she's strong.


Momiji              ****

Comparatively strong in close combat, and also has good detection abilities.


Aya                 *****

She's the fastest out of all characters. Basic stats and special abilities 
are excellent as well.


Sanae               **

A special class that requires chanting for some time before using special
abilities. Can't say she's easy to use.


Kanako              ***

Gains power depending on amount of uniques defeated. Very strong in endgame,
but pretty average early on.


Suwako              ***

She can use all realms of Sorcery Arts, but you can use them to full extent
only past midgame. There's plenty of gimmicky spells in Sorcery Arts, and you
need to be careful with her hibernation ability.


* Subterranean Animism

Kisume              *

Extremely strict equipment restrictions on top of hard to use special abilites.
A class for experienced players.


Yamame              **

Uses poison and spiderwebs (obstructs movement). Can be somewhat decent in early game,
but past midgame your abilities will be less effective; it's going to be tough.


Parsee              **

Becomes stronger when going against powerful enemies or being low on HP, but...
You have to fight in close combat, and you're not good at it.


Yuugi               ****

Strict equipment restrictions and has difficulty raising skills, but that aside,
her physical power is overwhelming.


Satori              **

Fights by reading enemy mind and copying their powers. Strong if used properly,
but requires knowledge about monsters and a unique approach.


Rin                 **

Somewhat gimmicky character that can focus either on martial arts or magic;
can be decent if you go past midgame. You can carry extra items around in your
cart, which is pretty handy.


Utsuho              ****

A class focused on scorching everything in sight. Early game is pretty easy,
but you have to carefully pick your fights past midgame.


Koishi              ***

Assassin-like class that can constantly land critical hits without being
noticed by enemies. However, you teleport and lose your memories at random,
so she's not suited for relaxed play.


* Undefined Fantastic Object

Nazrin              **

Has several detection abilities, but weak at combat.


Kogasa              ***

The weapon she's holding (her true umbrella body) slowly powers up as you
level up. However, she's not that good at defense, and will easily get
defeated if you get careless.


Ichirin             ***

Focuses on martial arts. Has pretty good defenses and can use some
ranged attacks.


Minamitsu           **

Focuses on martial arts. An ominous class that floods nearby area with water
and drowns living beings. Strong if you pick your fights properly, but
isn't suited for beginners.


Shou                ****

Excellent warrior class. However, you start out with very low weapon skills,
so you have to practice on weaker enemies before you become somehow proficient.


Byakuren            ***

Powerful martial art class, but weak unless she's applying her physical
enhancement spell. Has low MP, which makes early game tough.


Nue                 *****

You don't need to carry a light source. Normally takes the form of a monstrosity
and powers up, but this effect gets dispelled if an enemy sees through her
deception. She's pretty strong even without it, though.


* Ten Desires

Kyouko              **

Low base stats, and many abilities are hard to use (they're sound attacks that
wake up nearby enemies).


Yoshika             ***

Very high endurance, plenty of resistances and resilient to status abnormalities.
If you don't spend enough bonus points on dexterity, you won't get many blows
per round. Perception and magic device skills are extremely low, so you'll have
trouble past midgame.


Seiga               ***

Magic specialist that's not good at close combat. Playing spellcasters generally
requires more game knowledge and strategic approaches compared to other classes.
Comparatively easily for a spellcaster class, but still not that suited for
beginners.


Tojiko              ***

Ranged combat + lightning user. Can pass through walls, but has the disadvantage
of being unable to use footwear.


Mononobe            ***

Ranged class with gimmicky special abilities that use plates. Can use magic to
some extent as well. Hard to use until you get used to her special abilities.


Miko                ****

She might be a genius who excels at everything, but she's hard to master
unless you're knowledgeable enough about using spells. Might not be the best
choice for beginners.


Mamizou             ****

Powerful if you master her 'Transform' special ability, but it's very unique
one and not suited for beginners. But even without using it, she's clearly
above average in terms of strength.


* Double Dealing Character

Wakasagihime        *

Weak outside water, and you don't get abilities to create water on your own
until late game. Has many restrictions like being unable to use footwear or
moving slower on land without levitation.


Sekibanki           **

A class that fights with the support of her head clones. Can be overwhelmed
by enemy summoners past midgame. Her combat skills are average without using clones.


Kagerou             ***

Her parameters aren't that high, but she has useful special abilities and can
fight pretty well to some extent. She can't read scrolls in her wolf form, so if
you get surrounded, transform before you get low on health.


Benben              **

Dual class + gimmicky support special abilities. Strong in endgame, but hard to use.


Yatsuhashi          **

Spellcaster + gimmicky support special abilities. Strong in endgame, but hard to use.


Seija               *

Has extremely low stats and can't use magic; you'll have to fight using your
special abilities. Not suited for beginners at all.


Shinmyoumaru        ****

She became human-sized through the power of Miracle Mallet. Starts out with a good
weapon, making early game combat easier. Her Miracle Mallet special abilities can
be very useful, but you should carefully check what demerits they might have.


Raiko               ***

A special class that learns an ability powering her up depending on wielded weapon.
Strong but not suited for beginners.


* Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom

Seiran              **

Weak if you don't find a good gun, and guns themselves are hard to use.


Ringo               ***

Her parameters aren't high, but she powers up by eating dango. Eat them
without hesitation before going against powerful enemies. Also has several
exploration-related special abilities.


Doremy              ***

A class that demonstrates her true power in the dangerous Dream World dungeon.


Sagume              *

Spellcaster class that has a very special mechanic changing usual effects of
scrolls she reads. For those who have grown tired of normal gameplay.


Clownpiece          *

Starts with 30000 HP and very high parameters, but cannot recover HP at all.
You'll be able to take down anyone for a while, but you need experience in
order to minimize damage taken and clear the game. Completely different gameplay style.


Junko               **

Gacha-like spellmaster that also has combat skills. Strong even without prior
knowledge, but spends a lot of resources. Once you understand how to use her
various special abilities, you'll be able to do anything. For those used to the game.


Hecatia             ***

She can change bodies, swapping equipment, personality and studied magic realm.
Top class in terms of strength, but it's hard to say she's suited for beginners.


* Hidden Star in Four Seasons

Eternity Larva      *

As you level up, your stats greatly increase and you gain mutations. However,
your stats are despairingly low in early game.


Nemuno              ***

Close combat class that can designate a room in the dungeon as her 'sanctuary',
increasing her power as she defends it. Pretty strong, but not good at facing
powerful enemy summoners.


Aunn                ***

An average level martial art class with good detection and defensive abilities.


Narumi              ***

Strong and endurant, despite being a spellcaster class. If you pick her special
personality, her special abilities become more combat oriented.


Satono              **

Special riding class that controls follower by dancing behind their backs.
Magic oriented. Has lot of gimmicks and isn't suited for beginners.


Mai                 ***

Special riding class that controls follower by dancing behind their backs.
Physical combat oriented. Has lot of gimmicks and isn't suited for beginners.


Okina               *****

Comparatively weak in early game compared to other strong classes, but
she eventually learns cheat tier abilities, becoming one of the strongest
classes in endgame


* Wily Beast and the Weakest Creature

Eika                *

Has some defensive skills, but severaly lacks in offense. Bad at using weapons
(aside from throwing). Her racial abilities can change during gameplay (stray
god feature), so she might end up being powerful in endgame, but she's weak
otherwise.


Urumi               ****

Warrior class that can use some slightly different support abilities. It feels
good to slow enemies down or power up your critical hits. Keep in mind
she show her true potential only at later stages.


Kutaka              ***

Dual class leaning toward spellcasting. Has many useful abilities like
detection, water generation, powerful massacre. If you make preparations to use 
her Old Castle reward - Chicken Knife - her melee attack power will be devastating.
Maybe suited for people beginners who want a slightly more difficult class?


Yachie              ****

Monk that can study a realm of Sorcery Arts, and also with counter-summoning
special abilties. Body armor and head equipment restrictions might be somewhat
overwhelming.


Mayumi              *****

Warrior/cavalry/haniwa summoner. A cavalry unique class with excellent
starting equipment and stats. Your strength and constituion can't go below
your wisdom, so you'll have high stats in early game.


Keiki               *****

Secondhand dealer/jeweler with high stats and versatile special abilities.
You can comfortably play around with items.


Saki                *****

An excellent class that can use most of spells you want to use for close combat,
along with high aptitude for riding and dual gun combat. Very strong and
has no gimmicks; recommended for beginners.


* Unconnected Marketeers

Takane              **

Can carry more cards than average card trader + has defensive abilities.
Incredibly strong in late game, but has trouble early on; can't say she's
suited for beginners.


Sannyo              (???)

Card trader + continuous debuff special abilities


Momoyo              *****

Extremely good at close combat and can buff herself, but she's horrible at searching.


* Tasogare Danmaku Action

Suika               *****

Highest HP out of all classes (Clownpiece aside), incredibly good at close
combat, can power herself up even more with special abilities. She gets weaker
if she sobers up, but she can drink sake by activating her gourd.


Iku                 ****

Decent both at close combat and magic, and starts out with a powerful
cloak that she has to keep equipped. Very quick at sensing floor danger level.


Tenshi              ****

Good at close combat and has high parameters. Starts out with a powerful weapon,
but it's force branded and drains your MP when you attack, making it somewhat
difficult to use.


Kokoro              ***

Can create masks by defeating enemies with a special ability, and then use
that enemy's powers while wearing that mask. Very strong if you master her,
but not suited for beginners.


Shinmyoumaru II     **

This is the Urban Legend in Limbo version that rides in a bowl. High stealth
and fairly high attack power, but her HP is too low. You have to keep
movement order in mind. If you pick her special personality, you'll be able
to summon other Gensoukyou residents, but be careful not to get hit by their
attacks.


Renko               ***

Mindcrafter + some extra mindcraft abilities mainly related to throwing
objects. Uses both 'm' and 'J' commands, keep that in mind. High combat power,
but requires a somewhat special approach.


Joon                ***

Special martial artist that can equip up to 8 rings at once. Excellent firepower
and special abilities in late game, but might be somewhat hard to use in
early-mid game.


Shion               *

She can't buy anything at stores, and her equipment gets seized after a certain
time period. Has a very unique gameplay where you keep possessing monsters one
after another, since you hardly can fight by yourself. Requires very careful
planning; not recommended for beginners.


* Other works

Three Fairies       **

Very flexible equipment-wise, since you're effectively controlling three
people at once. If you can set up your equipment properly, combined with
their magic-sealing silence ability, they're surprisingly strong past midgame.
Has hard time in early game and requires discerning which enemies would be
affected by silence, so it's a class for more skilled players.


Sunnymilk           *

Stronger during daytime, weaker at night. However, her base parameters are
very low. A challenge class for experienced players.


Lunachild           *

Stronger at night, weaker during daytime. However, her base parameters are
very low. A challenge class for experienced players.


Star Sapphire       *

Can sense living beings from the start, but fragile. Her base parameters are
very low. A challenge class for experienced players.


Kasen               *****

A rare close combat class skilled both in martial arts and riding. Her stats
are high all around as well. Keep in mind you can't wear heavy armor if
you'll focus on the martial art side.


Hatate              ***

Fairly high stats and useful special abilities; however, she's proficient in
comparatively minor weapons like crossbows and guns.


Rei'sen             **

Neither her stats or special abilities are combat oriented.


Toyohime            ***

She starts out with the latest Lunarian weapon, making early game very easy.
Past midgame, you'll have to watch out for enemies that can high your
vulnerabilities. Somewhat difficult to use, since she's focused on spellcasting
and summoning.


Yorihime            ****

Starts out with a powerful katana, making early game very easy. Past midgame, 
you'll have to watch out for enemies that can high your vulnerabilities. 
Has somewhat gimmicky special abilities.


Kosuzu              *

Very weak in combat by herself; you'll have to master her transformation
abilities and the powerful scrolls she starts the game with. Not suited
for beginners at all.


Clownpiece (alt)    **

This is the Sangatsusei version. Has low base stats and fairly gimmicky
special abilities.
