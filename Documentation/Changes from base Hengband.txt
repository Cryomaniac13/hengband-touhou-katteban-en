* General

- Made it more 'Touhou-like' by having nobody die (or at least being plausibly not dead).
  Removed all corpse items and changed all 'You have killed X' messages I could find.

- Most of the options at the start of the game are now set as 'difficulty level' you pick.

- Yukari is the midboss at level 50 in Angband, Oberon is final boss at level 100.
  On EASY difficulty level game ends once you defeat Yukari, on NORMAL you can retire
  after defeating Yukari.

- Score is sent to this katteban's separate server. Unlike original version, save data is
  written directly, so please do not write down your personal information.
  (Translated version doesn't send score to server)

* Commands

- Classes that don't use spellbooks use their special abilities with 'J' command,
  instead of 'm' or 'U'. (Mindcrafters use 'm' command)

- 'j' command browses special abilities.

- (With roguelike commands on, 'S' uses special abilities, 'P' browses them)

- 'b' command browses spells, class special abilities and racial powers.

- Removed 'jam' action.

- Several special items can be used with 'u' command from your inventory.

* Classes

- Added special classes called 'Unique classes'. Basically, they let you roleplay as
  the Touhou characters, giving you fixed race, sex and name. Unique classes can change
  their class name with the name change command.

- Most general classes were replaced or had their abilities altered.

- If something class-like comes up in a future Touhou work, more changes might be
  implemented.

* Races

- Limited races only to those appearing in Touhou works (with some exceptions). Changed
  existing races somewhat.
- Caution: Vampires entering bodies of water without levitation will start drowning
  regardless of encumbrance and resistance.
- Unique classes can't change their race (with some exceptions).

* Magic

- Significantly remade the magic system.

- Amount of realms increased from 10(+1) to 13. They're split into 'Major Realms', if
  your second studied realm belongs to other major realm than your first, you receive
  penalties. Read help files for more details.

- Each race has its own aptitude for different realms. It changes spell difficulty
  and minimum level to learn it. Some races can't study certain realms at all.

- Basically, all classes study and cast spells with intelligence. Wisdom influences
  maximum MP and greatly increases protection from magic.

- If you're wearing gloves unsuitable for spellcasting, not only your MP is reduced,
  but your failure rate goes higher as well. High dexterity reduces this penalty.

- If you're wearing heavy armor, not only your MP is reduced, but spell MP cost is
  increased as well. High strength reduces this penalty, and it is lower for dual
  classes.

* Dungeons/Map

- Anti-melee cave replace by Hermit training ground, anti-magic cave replaced by
  Inverted Castle.

- Beginner dungeon similar to Yeek Cave is the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum 
  at Myouren Temple close to Human Village.

- If you visit Eientei after winning, you can challenge the EX dungeon. It might
  be extremely difficult to clear depending on your class.

* Quests

- Implemented item delivery quests. If you visit the quest giver while carrying
  the specified item, you can give it through item selection menu, completing the
  quest. If you visit them without the proper item, you can decline and intentionally
  fail the quest.

- Implemented quests to defeat a wanted person. Unlike Warg Quest, nothing happens
  if you visit the quest level in the dungeon. After receiving the quest, the wanted
  person will be able to get randomly generated in dungeons; defeat them to complete
  the quest.

- In several quests, several enemies start out awake. Be warned, some quests can get
  very dangerous if you act carelessly at the start.

* Elements/Resistances

- Added water resistance. If you have it, water attacks won't destroy your items,
  and you won't drown if you enter water overencumbered (aside from vampires)

- Added holy energy resistance. Priest-class monsters use holy attacks instead of
  curses. It's somewhat difficult to cover.

- Some races and magic realms are vulnerable to holy attacks. Youkai and like take 
  33% more damage, undead and demons take 33% more damage on top of that, and if 
  you're studying darkness or necromancy realm, that extra 33% damage.

- Added (space-)time resistance. Protects against time/nexus/gravity attacks and
  teleport away, but very difficult to cover.

- Added insanity resistance. Protects from eldritch horrors and cosmic horrors
  (see below). Very difficult to cover, but undead and demon races have it covered
  from the beginning.

- Removed nexus resistance. Changed nexus attacks into power space-time attacks used
  by endgame enemies. Cannot teleport you to another level.

- Combined Hold Life with nether resistance.

- Added equipment ability 'Swift movement'. Increases your movement speed depending
  on your level (up to double), but it's fairly difficult to obtain.

- Added tornado elemnt. Can't be resisted, but you can protect yourself with levitation
  or carrying a lot of weight.

- Removed radioactive waste element.

- Added nuclear heat element. It's half fire and half light. Godzilla/Gachapin breath it
  instead of radioactive waste, be careful

- Changed plasma element to composite of fire and lightning. You can protect yourself
  with resistances, but it hits harder.

- Renamed force element to 'Ki'. Removed force breath, added 'Ki sphere'. Power depends
  on HP, is used by Meiling and Nappa.

- Some endgame enemies now can use hellfire element attacks. Celestials/Moon rabbits/Lunarians
  take great damage from it. Cannot be resisted.

* Monsters

- Changed 'good/evil' enemies to 'lawful/chaotic'.
  To avoid dividing Touhou characters into 'good' or 'evil', all of them don't belong to
  either of those groups.

- Changed some monster symbols.
  c: Combined with spiders  t: Townsfolk -> Tengu  y: Yeek -> Small youkai
  F: Dragonfly -> Fairy  H: Combined with yeti  I: Combined with beetles/dragonflies
  K: Beetle -> Kappa  S: Spider -> Deity  Y: Yeti -> Large/humanoid youkai
  Be careful not to mistake Atlach-Nacha/Defiler/Lady Suwako for a regular mob.

- Changed monster classification in regards to ESP/slays.
  Combined orcs/trolls/giants (as humanoids) with humans.
  Added youkai and deity slay/ESP.
  Added lawful (good) slay for weapons.

- Added around 300 monsters. Mainly Touhou characters, but not limited to them.

- Removed townsfolk, yeeks and some joke monsters.

- Added/changed various monster spells. Some dangerous ones: Exorcism 1-4 (similar to curse,
  but hits with holy energy + stuns), cosmic horror (if you don't resist insanity, unresistable 
  powerful mental attack + extra effects), meteor strike (large ball spells that deals meteor
  element damage), wide laser (beam of nuclear heat), holy breath, elemental storms, teleport
  next to player without having line of sight.

- Made Lords of Amber stronger. In particular, Eric, Corwin and Benedict are very powerful,
  so watch out. All of them are lawful, so unlike original version, slay evil won't work.

- Since Oberon is the final boss, he became even stronger than before. He counts as a deity,
  and human slays won't work. Having shard/light/holy resistances will be important. I can't
  recommend fighting using your followers.

- Several Cthulhu-class uniques got the aforementioned cosmic horror spells and got powered up.

- Tyrannosaurus, Wyrms of Space-Time, tanuki (changed to youkai tanuki/elder youkai tanuki),
  Stormbringer (changed to Elric) were powered up from their original version and now appear
  on deeper levels.

- Changed names for several monsters like Hell Wyrms or Water Hounds.

- Many Gensoukyou monsters use 'Danmaku' attack. Non-elemental, damage is equal to enemy level.

- Added new kinds of melee attacks. For example: 'Wound (causes wounds, damage can be reduced
  by AC)', 'Drown (stuns if you don't resist water)', 'Invite to death (stuns a lot if you don't
  resist nether)', 'Attack with elements (random basic element attack)'

- Reimu and Marisa are special unique monsters with variable parameters. They keep on appearing
  no matter how many times you defeat them. They drop valuable items on deeper levels, but they're
  also ridiculously powerful at that point.

- Implemented random uniques. You can somewhat tell their strength and affinity by their name,
  but don't get overconfident.

* Battle System

- Removed launcher slot, replaced with 'Ribbon'.

- Bows now are weapons you hold with both hands. You can hold them along with another weapon
  or a shield, but you will receive penalties.

- If your riding skill is high enough, your mount won't move by itself if you let go of reins,
  and as you get even more skilled, you can control your mount even without holding the reins.

- Split Aggravate Monsters into 'Shriek' and 'Alarm'. Former wakes upon enemies in nearby
  area, but does not haste them. Latter works like the original Aggravate Monsters.

- Several races/classes/mutations might have equipment restrictions. For example, maids have
  to wear a maid uniform, tengu have to wear a tokin, if you grow large horns, you can't wear
  helmets.

- If your equipment becomes unusable after you change your race, it will drop to the ground.
  Be careful.

- Weapon proficiency is split between classes of weapons instead of each item having its own
  proficiency level. The classes are: Short Blades, Long Blades, Katanas, Blunt Weapon, Staves,
  Axes, Spears, Polearms, Bows, Crossbows and Guns.

- Proficiency for Martial Arts, Shields, Riding, Dual-Wielding and Throwing is raised in a 
  similar way.

- You can hold any weapon aside from short blades with both hands. It's weird to hold a rapier
  or hatchet with both hands, but that's the mechanic.

- Wielding short blades with high proficiency level raises amount of blows.

- Added a lot of 'gun' items, and greatly changed related system. In short, it's now
  'a rod you can equip'. Since there's little chance to use guns unless you're playing as
  a class with high aptitude for them, added a gameplay option that prevents guns from
  being generated. For more details, read the 'Other' help file.

- Slightly increased strength bonus for holding a weapon with both hands, also your maximum
  amount of blows in melee will be increased by 1.

- Proficiency level aptitude depends on class; it affects how quickly you gain proficiency
  and your maximum attainable level. Changed proficiency display from 'Novice/Expert/etc'
  to numeric value up to 50.

- Any class can deal several blows with martial arts. Blow amount depends on martial art
  aptitude/class/level/dexterity/etc. Wearing heavy armor or using a shield reduces the
  amount of blows. Having high strength increases the heavy armor limit.

- Martial art attacks can differ depending on race/mutations/special transformations.
  If you're not a martial art class, youkai/were-beasts/oni deal more powerful blows
  than humans.

- If you have certain mutations or are proficient enough in martial arts or shields,
  you can get additional attacks when fighting with weapons.

- If you fight with martial arts, the damage per turn displayed with 'C' commmand can
  vary - that's a feature.

- Being terrified now lowers ranged accuracy and increases spell failure rate.

- Unique classes have many special abilities with power depending on charisma.

- If your followers (pets) are of higher level than you, you get a penalty on their
  maintenance cost. (there are exceptions)

- Increased penalties while drowning.

* Mutations

- Several mutation - horns or your lower body turning into a merfolk tail - can
  make you unable some pieces of your equipment, dropping them on the floor.
  Be careful.

- Several races have their physical characteristics treated as mutations.
  They can't be removed with curing mutations or Potion of New Life.

- Made all of your mutations go away when you change your race. 'Lucky' personality's
  white aura won't go away.

- The asthma mutation can make you occasionally fail to read scrolls if it worsens.
  Be careful.

* Items

- As mentioned earlier, removed all corpses. Also removed bounty hunt system.

- Removed iron spikes/statues/junk items.

- Added 'ribbon' equipment items. They don't have many artifacts, you're mainly
  using their ego-items to complete the resistance puzzle.

- Changed some base weapon/armor items. Changed resistances for high level dragon
  scale mail.

- Changed various ego-items.

- Changed/added artifacts. Stormbringer was significantly powered up, but now it's
  permanently cursed, so be careful.

- Implemented 'Sake' category. If you drink it, your drunkedness level increases.
  At first it grants heroism, then it causes several effects to occur at random,
  then it causes even more effects to occur at random, and then it knocks you
  unconscious. Depending on your race and sake kind, you might get knocked out in a
  single drink, so be careful. If you have 'Alcoholic' mutation, you won't get
  knocked out no matter how much you drink, but your parameters get lowered once you're
  sober.

- Implemented 'Material' category. They can be used as catalysts for several spells,
  for powering up weapons or creating other items. You can exchange them for points
  at Kirisame Magic Shop.

- Implemented 'Curio' category. They're primarily exchanged for money at Kourindou,
  but you can use some with 'u' command.

- Some other changes to other categories.

- 'Searching' parameters affects probability of material items being generated.
  Some materials can only be generated at special dungeons.

- There are other items affected by Searching, aside from materials. For example,
  on lower levels of Scarlet Devil Mansion, high level spellbooks can be found
  more often.

- I thought weapon weight was unrealistically large, so I made them lighter.
  It might make getting extra blows too easy, though.

- Scrolls of Artifact Creation can be used on rings/amulets/ribbons as well.

- Made powerful random artifacts slightly more likely to get generated on
  deep levels.

- Made white aura effect stronger. It's particularly useful at the point
  ego-items and random artifacts are generated.

- Changed Capture balls to 'Demon books'. They're occasionally sold at the bookstore
  in Human Village. They're used in the same way.

- Made dice bonus (like for using a lance while riding) get reflected on the
  equipment screen.

* Towns/etc

- From role-playing perspective, you don't have an exploration base (your home) at first.
  By clearing quests (Thieves Hideout at Human Village, Logrus Master at Tengu Village,
  Haunted House at Former Hell) you can obtain an exploration base there.

- Renamed museum to 'House Entrance'. Located at the same building as your exploration
  base. It's close to house entrance, so be careful not to accidentally drop off something
  important.

- Removed Bounty Hunter and Arena.

- Removed Casino, but you can gamble on teams of monsters fighting each other at
  Hakurei Shrine.

- Combined Weaponmaster, bow/ammo enchantment and weapon/armor enchantment into a single
  building.

- Combined Trump Tower and Sage Tower. Teleportation to other towns is performed at this
  building instead of inns.

- Eientei can cure mutations (located in lower middle on world map).

- Items can be *identified* at Scarlet Devil Mansion or Kourindou.

- Implemented Kirisame Magic Shop. You can accumulate points by giving items like materials,
  and then exchange those points for items.

* Other

- Changed autoroller to Wizardry-like bonus point system. It's harder to get a lot of bonus
  points compared to Wizardry; 25 is a good amount.

- Changed parameter display from 18/100 to plain numbers. Normal limit is 40, but several
  potions, special abilities and spells can temporarily increase them up to 50.

- Removed height, weight, age and social status.

- Slightly changed score calculation; it is normally shown during gameplay at top of screen.
  Score is influenced by experience (up to 10,000,000), total amount of money (including
  items in inventory and at home, up to $10,000,000), most expensive treasure 
  (up to $1,000,000), defeated uniques, completed quests, amount of game days elapsed,
  with race/class modifiers on top of that.

- Added option to display items on the floor in a subwindow. It displays a list of items
  beneath player's feet or at the cursor position.

- The option 'Interrupt when a high level monster moves' now works even you're not aware
  of the actual level of monster.
