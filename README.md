Hengband Touhou Katteban (English Translation)

First of all, I am not the actual author of the variant itself. Only thing I
did was translating it into English and putting it on GitHub; it was
originally available through the author's website.

Here's the author's page with most recent build available:
http://www.miyamasa.net/heng_th_katte.html

Keep in mind the website blocks several IP ranges; try using a VPN/proxy
if you can't normally access it.


Notes:

- This is not the most recent version of Touhou Katteban. The source code
available for download on author's website are outdated compared to newest
build (as of point of writing, newest build version is 1.1.94a, source
code is 1.1.90). 

- Keep in mind I'm not that proficient in Japanese, and English isn't my
native language either. This is an amateur translation at best; expect
mistranslations and/or awkward wording. I apologize in advance.

- As of now, this is a very preliminary translation. Here's what's not done:

  - Speech lines for Gensoukyou uniques (Touhou Project characters)
  - English help files are still from base Hengband
  - I might have missed something else as well

- I've also taken some pages from the Japanese wiki for this project and
translated them in text form. They're in the Documentation folder.

- I didn't have Visual Studio on hand, but I managed to compile using
Borland C++. The makefile I'm using is makefile.bcc. Keep in mind you have
to run it in Japanese locale in order to make it work.
