Keine - 'Well, let's finally begin our adventure.
It starts from the entrance to Human Village.
Do you see those colorful symbols that make up the 'town'?
Let's look over what they mean.

Player (@)
The '@' in the middle is you.
Move with keyboard arrow/numpad keys.

Floor (.)
White/green dots are floor/ground areas. You can walk on them.

Forest (#)
The green '#' represents forests. You walk somewhat more slowly through here.

Wall (%)
On game screen, they're light-brown rectangles, but in this text file,
they're represented by '%'. You can tunnel through white walls, but those
light-brown ones are indestructible.

Door (+)
In town areas, this represents an entrance to a building. You can use
various facilities if you enter. However, in dungeons, it's treated as an
obstacle that can be opened or closed.

Numbers (1~9)
Those are store entrances. You can buy items here.
Sometimes, stores can appear in dungeons as well.

Letters (a~z, A~Z), symbols
Those various letters and symbols represent monsters.
The 'f' a bit to the right of the player is one of them.
This one is just a stray cat, but the dungeon will be filled with dangerous
monsters.

In order to move, attack or do something else, you enter a command through
keyboard input. The most basic commands required for early game are listed in
the Beginner's Guide.
There are no dangerous monsters in Human Village, so walk around for a bit and
test out various commands.

Once you reach the edge of the map, you will move to an adjacent map screen,
and the area you've just left will be generated once again.
Don't carelessly move to another map screen after dropping some valuable
items.'

***** <Shopping>
=== Shopping ===

Keine - 'Now, let's talk about stores.
You can buy or sell items at stores.
The higher your charisma is, the better prices you get.
The numbers 1~9 in Human Village represent store entrances.
Sometimes, they sell expensive items that have slightly unusual names.
I'll talk about items in more details later on.'

1: General Store
Keine - 'You can buy food, lanterns and lantern oil here.
You also can buy a pick to dig through walls.'

2: Armoury
Keine - 'You can buy clothes and armor here.
If you're using magic, wearing heavy equipment or ordinary gloves can
affect your spellcasting.'

3: Weapon Store
Keine - 'You can buy weapons and arrows here.
You'll probably be fine with your starting weapon for a while.
However, some dual classes might start out with a somewhat weak weapon, so
you might want to purchase something you can hold with both hands.'

4: Potion/Liquor Store
Keine - 'You can buy potions and alcohol here.
You'll want to purchase some healing potions if you have spare money.'

5: Scroll Store
Keine - 'You can buy scrolls here.
Scrolls have various effects and are vital for your adventure.
First of all, purchase some Scrolls of Teleportation for emergency escape.
Don't forget about Scrolls of Word of Recall once you start going deeper into
the dungeon.'

6: Magic Store
Keine - 'You can buy items like rings, amulets and magic staves here.
Staves and wands have limited amount of uses, but they're convenient tools
that aren't too heavy.'

7: Pawn Shop/Thieves Market
Keine - 'Various items are being sold at the pawn shop.
Many of them are very powerful and aren't sold at other stores, but their
selling price is very high as well.
If you have enough money, it might be worth to check it out.
Looks like various locations sell items of slightly varied value.'

8: Exploration Base
Keine - 'This is the storeroom you're free to use. You can place hundreds of
items you can't carry with you here.
It's not available at the start of your adventure, but if you resolve some
requests from town residents, they might let you use a building as your
exploration base.'

9: Bookstore
Keine - 'You can buy spellbooks here.
The more powerful ones aren't being sold.
Also, you can't find spellbooks of Sorcery Arts in Human Village.'

10: Entrance
Keine - 'Becomes available once you get an exploration base.
You can place thousands of items here, but you can't take those items back.
If you find a worthless but valuable item and don't want to throw it away,
decorate your entrance with it.'

Keine - 'You should identify items before selling them.
Unidentified items always sell for low prices.
Also, shops change their inventory several times a day.
If you want an item you can't afford, hurry and get money before it gets sold.

As an aside, original Hengband had several other store-related mechanics,
but many of them got removed in this mod. For example, haggling for price,
racial-based price adjustment and maximum selling price got removed.'

***** <Buildings>
=== Other Buildings ===

Keine - 'The '+' symbols represents doors in the dungeon; in town areas, it
represents entrance to a building you can use.
You can do various thing at them. Here's some examples:

- Hieda House
Hieda House in Human Village can identify your items for a low price.
For a more significant price, you can learn all information about a specific
monster.

- Rest at the inn
Most of towns have an inn where you can purchase food or rest.
The inns also have a bar, where you can listen to rumors in that town.

- Quest
Some people might request you to do something. I'll explain it later.

- Blacksmith
You can enhance weapon/armor or compare your weapons here for a price.

- *Identify* items
Several powerful items have special effects you won't learn about simply
by identifying them. You can examine them in more details at Kourindou or
Scarlet Devil Mansion Library.
However, it's somewhat expensive.

- Divine Spirit Mausoleum Branch Office
The recently resurrected saint opened those up in several towns.
Here, you can recharge your magic devices like staves, teleport to other
towns, or recall to the deepest level of a dungeon you've visited.
Don't forget to bring your own means of recalling if you're going to dungeon.

- Eientei
You can treat most of illnesses at Eientei.
This includes stat/experience drain and mutations.
However, it might be difficult to navigate Bamboo Forest to get there.

- Hakurei Shrine
You can restore drained stats and remove curses from your equipment here.
However, it's pretty expensive. Maybe there's some way to get a discount?
Looks like there are some kappas gambling in a corner as well.

- Guilds
Marksman/engineer guilds. If you belong to one of those classes, you can
request special services here.

- Kirisame Magic Shop
Marisa has opened up a shop in Forest of Magic.
If you gather materials, you can exchange them here for points, which you
can use to get presents.
But don't go around there unless you're confident in your skills to some
degree.

- Grassroots Youkai Network 
Looks like there's a mutual aid organization for weak youkai unaffliated
with other major Gensoukyou residents.

***** <FixedQuests>
=== Fixed Quests ===

Keine - 'You can receive quests at specific locations.
Many of quests involve driving away monsters, but some of them require
finding a specific item. If you complete a quest, the quest giver will
give you a reward.

However, some of the quests are incredibly dangerous.
The danger level is more or less represented by quest level.
It'll be dangerous if you're uncomfortable walking around in dungeon at that
depth. You can check quest information and danger level with Ctrl+q command.

If you 'l'ook at a quest dungeon entrance, you'll see which quest it leads to.
Be careful not to accidentally enter a dangerous quest.

Many of the monster extermination quests have the quest dungeon appear in that
town area. Once you're prepared, go inside.
If you can't defeat the enemies, go up the staircase to leave the quest, but
it will count as failed, and you won't receive a reward.

You can leave and re-enter exploration base related quests without a risk of
failure. However, once you go back inside, all items on the floor will
disappear.

Some magic like *Destruction* or Massacre can't be used in quest dungeons.'

***** <WorldMap>
=== World Map ===

Keine - 'By pressing '<' on surface, you switch to the global world map
displaying all of Gensoukyou. Once you enter it, the map area you've left will
be generated once again, so be careful not to leave anything valuable behind.
You can walk on world map just like on normal one. However, time advances
quickly here. Think of each step on world map taking as much time as going
from one end of a normal map to the opposite end.

There are other various towns aside from Human Village, along with some
dungeons. To the west of the village, there's a creepy cave called 'Angband'.
Clearing it is your goal. However, if you're just starting out, you might
train at the simple Dreams Mausoleum dungeon located at Myouren Temple to the
south-east of the village.

You might get ambushed by monsters as you move around on the world map.
If you get ambushed, you get returned to normal map view, with several
monsters around you. It's a good idea to avoid fighting them and run to map
edge as quickly as you can.
Monster strength depends on terrain.
Forests (#), rivers (~) and mountains (^) contain enemies that are too strong
for new adventurers. Stay on the road (white '.') for now.'
