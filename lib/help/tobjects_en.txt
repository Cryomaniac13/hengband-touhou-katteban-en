=== Items ===
Keine - 'Collecting and using items is extremely important in roguelikes.
You won't be able to fight your way through the dungeon without obtaining
powerful equipment, collecting a lot of scrolls and healing potions, along
with various magic devices.
Let's look over various mechanics related to items.'

***** <EquipInvent>
=== Inventory and Equipment ===

Keine - 'You're carrying an adventurer's backpack which can contain up to
23 different kinds of items. A single food ration and 99 suits plate mail both
count as a single 'kind'. Many items will stack in a single slot if there's
multiple of them; however, staves with different amount of charges left,
equipment with different abilities and some other special items can't stack.

Aside from your inventory, you have 'equipment'.
It goes without saying that weapons and armor will have no effect unless you
wield/wear them. There are 12 equipment slots:
Right hand, left hand, ribbon, right hand finger, left hand finger, neck,
light source, body, cloak, head, hands, feet.

You can hold weapons/shields in your hands.
If you wield a weapon other than a short blade and your other hand is free,
you will automatically hold it with both hands, increasing attack power.
You also can hold a bow or wield a single weapon in each hand.
There are some special items like demon books that you have to hold in your
hand in order to use them.

You'll probably understand in which slot a piece of equipment goes by
looking at it. You don't have to remove your gloves to put on or remove rings,
and if you wear a full plate mail, your head/feet slots are still free.

When you remove a piece of equipment, it automatically goes into your
inventory. If your inventory is full, it is dropped beneath your feet.

Several classes have their own item container separate both from equipment
and inventory - Secondhand-Dealer's toolbox, Engineer's backpack, Rin's cart.
You should understand if you try using it.

If you're carrying too much weight, your speed will be reduced. In early game,
it will significantly decrease you combat power, so be careful.
And as I said before, using heavy equipment might make spells more difficult
to cast. To be more specific, MP cost increases according to how much you go
over the limit. Spellcasters in particular should watch out for this.
You strength determines how much you can carry without trouble.'

***** <UseItem>
=== Using Items ===

Keine - 'Several items causes some effects upon being used. I'll explain how
to use them. The following commands are for default key settings, if you're
using a different layout, look for explanation in Commands section.

You can use items both from your inventory and beneath your feet. When asked
to choose an item, press '_' to switch to items on the floor.

- Staves '_'
  Can be used with 'u'se command. Can affect either yourself or your nearby
  area. Staves have a limited amount of charges, and can't be used if it drops
  to zero. Staves with different amount of charges don't stack.
  You can recharge them at Divine Spirit Mausoleum Branch Office or with
  Recharging spells. However, if you fail to recharge with a spell/scroll, the
  item might break.

- Wands '-'
  Can be used with 'a'im command. Most of the make you target something, and
  then shoot in that direction.
  Magic wands will stack in a single slot regardless of amount of charges
  left. A stack of wands displays the total amount of charges.
  You can recharge them at Divine Spirit Mausoleum Branch Office or with
  Recharging spells. However, if you fail to recharge with a spell/scroll, the
  item might break.

- Rods '-'
  Can be used with 'z'ap command. Some of them require aiming at something,
  some of them simply cause an effect upon being used.
  Rods don't have charges, but they start recharging once you use them, and
  cannot be used during that period.
  Various rods have different recharge time. Rods will stack regardless of
  whether they're recharging or not.
  You can immediately finish recharging at Divine Spirit Mausoleum Branch
  Office or with Recharging spells. However, if you fail to recharge with a
  spell/scroll, the item might break.

- Ability Cards '#'
  Some ability cards are used with 'u' commands, some have a passive effect
  applied if you're carrying them. You can get a few as rewards for certain
  quests, and you can exchange them at Moriya Shrine.
  Some classes have to increase their power by buying those cards.

  Using staves, wands, rods and ability cards is linked to Magic Device skill.
  If your skill is level, you're very likely to fail to properly use high
  level magic devices. They're also hard to use if you're confused or berserk.

- Scrolls '?'
  Can be used with 'r'ead command. They disappear when you read them.
  You can't read if you're confused, blind, or in a non-illuminated area.
  You can't fail to read scrolls, except in the case you get a severe asthma
  attack.

- Food/mushrooms/sweets ','
  Can be eaten with 'E'at command. Naturally, they disappear once eaten.
  Normal races raise satiation level by eating food. Tsukumogami and Youkai
  Dolls consume charges from staves/wand, Golems can eat stones/ores.

- Potions/liquor/other drinks '!'
  Potions and liquor can be drunk with 'q' command. Naturally, they disappear
  when you drink them. Some of the potions are dangerous, so I advise against
  carelessly drinking them without knowing their effect.
  Drinking alcohol makes you heroic and removes fear, but various weird things
  start to happen if you drink too much, and you might get knocked out if you
  keep on drinking even more.
  Some alcohol is strong enough to knock you out on the spot, so be careful.

- Flasks of Oil '!'
  Your lantern will go out unless you refill it with oil.
  Can be used to refill lanterns with 'F' command.
  Magic lanterns and other high quality light sources don't require fuel.

That's about it.
Again, don't forget that you won't be able to use some items if you're
confused or blind.

***** <Activate>
=== Activating Items ===

Keine - 'Several pieces of equipment have spell-like effects that you can use
by activating them. Use 'A'ctivate command to use them; it can be done only
with items among your equipment, and you're more likely to fail if your Magic
Device skill is low. You can't activate items if you're confused.

For example, if you activate a Ring of Flames, you will shoot a fireball and
temporarily become more resistant to fire attacks.
Just like rods, the item will start recharging after you activate it.
You'll be able to activate it again after waiting a bit. However, items won't
recharge if you remove them from your equipment.'

***** <Ident>
=== Identifying Items ===

Keine - 'Identifying items you've picked up before using them is a basic
concept. You won't be able to tell the effect of items like staves/scrolls
you find for the first time before identifying them, and pieces of equipment
might have powerful curses on them.
Here's several methods of identification:

- Pseudo-identification
  If you pick up a piece of equipment and wait for a bit, you will get a
  feeling like 'You feel ## is good...'. It's a vague identification method
  that only works for equipment items, but you'll be able to discern what
  items you don't need.
  Pseudo-identification ability varies for different classes:
  Warriors are good at identifying weapons/armor, spellcasters are good at
  identifying rings. If you're not good at pseudo-id, it will happen slower
  and you will get an even more vague message.
  For example, a Warrior can tell if a weapon/armor is 'average', 'good',
  'excellent', or 'special'. A Mage will only be able if it's 'cursed' or
  'uncursed', and it will take more time to realise this.

- Identification
  The standard method of identifying items.
  If you use it on an item, for example, you'll be able to tell what kind of
  potion or staff it actually is.
  Once you've identified a specific item, you'll automatically recognize it
  once you find another one of them.
  If you identify a piece of equipment, you'll be able to tell its quality and
  stats, and if it's an ego-item or an artifact, you'll know what kind it is.
  However, you won't learn all special abilities of ego-items or artifacts at
  this point.

  There's plenty of methods of identification.
  There are staves and scrolls being sold at stores, and Hieda House can
  identify your items. Also, many adventurers can use identification abilities
  or spells.

  If you lose your memories due to an enemy spell or a special effect, you
  will forgot about some items you've identified.

- *Identification*
  The strongest method of identification.
  How do you read it? Feel free to shout 'Identify!'
  Once you use it, you'll learn everything about the item. You'll be able to
  check detailed information with 'I' command, and you'll know all abilites
  of ego-items and artifacts. And even if you lose your memories, you still
  won't forget this information.

  If you require *identification*, visit Scarlet Devil Mansion Library or
  Kourindou. Also, there are some powerful scrolls and spells with this
  effect. Items you buy from stores and items you start your adventure with
  are already *identified*.'

***** <CursedItem>
=== Cursed Items===
Keine - 'Some of items you pick up might be cursed.
You won't be able to remove them once you wield/wear them, and they might
have other negative effects.

There are three stages of curses.
- Normal curse
  Can be removed with Remove Curse. Might have some slightly nasty effects
  as well.
- Heavy curse
  Cannot be removed with ordinary Remove Curse; requires Scroll of *Remove
  Curse* or visiting a shrine.
  Might have some very nasty effects as well.
- Permanent curse
  Cannot be removed at all.
  You'll have to break the item itself with special spells or scrolls.

Now, let's take a look at various effects cursed items might have.
- HP/MP damage time from time
  You're unlikely to get taken down directly by this effect, but it still
  would be better to get rid of it.
- Increased hunger rate
  Might be dangerous depending on situation. You might want to return as soon
  as possible to remove it.
- Attracts dragons
  Occasionally activates, summoning a hostile dragon. Very dangerous.
- Aggravation
  Makes nearby enemies angry. Gameplay-wise, any sleeping enemies you approach
  will immediately wake up, and friendly beings will turn hostile.
  Be careful, it might cause a lot of trouble for summoners and in quest
  dungeons.
- Random teleportation
  Causes you to teleport at random. Particularly dangerous on lower levels.
  If the item isn't cursed, you can prevent random teleportation from being
  activated.
- Ancient Foul Curse
  Also called 'Topi Ylinen's Curse'.
  When it goes off, horrible things happen - like 'you get paralyzed ignoring
  free action', 'random teleportation', 'powerful monsters being summoned'.
  Several of those effects might happen in a row.
  There are some extremely powerful pieces of equipment with Ancient Foul
  Curse, but using them is a very risky gamble.

Tsukumogami and Tsukumo-Masters can remove cursed items without uncursing
them.

Usually, only equipment items can be cursed, but the 'Figurine of ##' items
might be cursed as well. If you throw a cursed figurine, it will turn into
a hostile monster and attack you.'

***** <EgoObjects>
=== Ego-items and Artifacts ===

Keine - 'Some pieces of equipment are clearly stronger than ordinary items.
Those are ego-items and artifacts.'

--- Ego-items ---

Keine - 'Ego-items are powerful pieces of equipment with spells cast on them.
If you're good at pseudo-id, they will show up as 'excellent'.
Once you identify them, their name will change to something like 'Long Sword
(Heroic)'. If you wield/wear them, they might give you various benefits, like
increasing your stats or giving resistances.
However, cursed ego-items exist as well. If you accidentally equip one of
them, you'll be in trouble.
You can view detailed information with 'I' command after *identifying* the
item.

--- Artifacts ---

Keine - 'Artifacts are legendary, one-of-a-kind items.
If you're good at pseudo-id, they will show up as 'special'.
Many artifacts are stronger than ego-items and have various effects.
The ones that have mostly strictly predefined are called 'fixed artifacts'.
Some of them are so rare you're extremely unlikely to find them.

There also are 'random artifacts', with random abilities you won't know
until you *identify* them. By the way, you might find a random artifact that's
more powerful than the strongest fixed artifacts.

Artifacts cannot be destroyed by enemy attacks, but if you sell them to a
store or leave them on the floor and move to another level, you won't see that
artifact again.

Also, cursed artifacts exist as well.
Accidentally wielding/wearing one might lead to really horrible results.'

***** <DestroyItem>
=== Item Destruction ===

Keine - 'Items lying on the floor can be destroyed if they get hit by spells
or breath attacks. For example, scrolls and staves can burn if exposed to fire
or melt if exposed to acid.
Swords and armors melt in acid.
Rings and wands get broken by lightning attacks.
Potions shatter upon getting hit by cold/shockwaves/shards/etc.
Chaos, disenchantmnet, mana, and disintegration attacks can destroy any items.
Spatial distortion and pollution attacks might destroy any items.

Items in your inventory also might get destroyed by enemy attacks.
In contrast to items lying on floor, there's only a chance of them getting
destroyed. If you're carrying dozens of scrolls, only some of them might get
burned up by a fire attack.
Having double resistance or immunity to basic elements (acid, lightning, fire,
cold) protects your items from being destroyed by those attacks.
Immunity is a special ability that completely protects you from that element,
double resistance is a state where you have innate/equipment resistance to
that element along with temporary resistance from a spell or similar source.
You can protect your items from being destroyed by higher elements if you
resist that element.
You cannot resist disintegration and mana, but those elements won't destroy
items in your inventory, so don't worry about that.

Some items cannot be harmed by basic elements, preventing them from being
destroyed in that manner. Artifacts cannot be destroyed at all.
For example, if there's a set of clothes lying around that is unharmed by an
acid attack, this item is either an artifact or some ego-item.

Items among your equipment cannot be destroyed by enemy attacks. However,
acid and disenchantment attacks can lower their stats.
Having disenchantment resistance prevents your equipment from being
disenchanted, having acid immunity prevents those items from being corroded.
Artifacts cannot be harmed by acid.

Also, some enemies can pick up or destroy items as they walk on them.
If an enemy has picked up an item, you can get it if you defeat them.
Monsters can't pick up or destroy artifacts.'

***** <DestroyItem2>
=== Item Vanishing ===

Keine - 'Items sometimes can disappear without being destroyed.
I've told earlier that artifacts can't be destroyed, but they still might end
up vanishing, so be careful.
Items can disappear in those cases:

- You go to another dungeon leaving the item on the floor
  If you recall or move to another dungeon, move to an adjacent map screen
  while on surface, or switch to global map mode, all items on the floor will
  disappear. Avoid mistakes like accidentally dropping an item in front of
  your house entrance (instead of storing it in your house) and then leaving
  the map.

- Item gets caught in an earthquake
  If an earthquake occurs in the dungeon, any items lying on open areas that
  end up turning into walls will be destroyed. However, terrain with artifacts
  lying on it won't be turned into a wall by an earthquake.

- Item gets *destroyed*
  *Destruction* is a powerful spell that breaks down the dungeon. If you use
  it, all items in its area will disappear - artifacts aren't an exception.

- Item gets dropped without free space nearby
  Items cannot be placed on terrain like walls, deep water/lava, closed doors,
  traps, runes, etc. If an item gets dropped on an area like this, it will
  move to a nearby available space instead. However, if there's no suitable
  areas nearby, the item will disappear.
  Same applies for weapons you throw and items dropped by defeated enemies.
  Keep that mind when fighting aquatic enemies or enemies with trap creation
  spells.

There are some special causes of item disappearance that are more related to
inner game workings than gameplay mechanics.
They're probably hard to understand, but remember them if possible.

- Map being generated again in quest processing
  When you receive a new quest or report a finished one, the map will get 
  generated again. All items lying on the floor at this point will disappear.
  Don't accept the next quest while leaving the reward for the previous one
  lying on the ground - it will disappear.

- Moving to another level with identified fixed artifact lying on the floor
  When you go to another dungeon, all items on the floor will disappear, but
  if you just go to another dungeon level using a staircase, the level will be
  preserved.
  However, identified fixed artifacts are an exception.
  If you leave a fixed artifact lying on floor, go down a staircase and then
  come back, for some reason, the artifact will disappear.
  This is an unnatural feature related to inner game workings. Be careful.
  (Should not happen past v1.0.75 (probably))

- Information about items on floor gets compressed
  If you defeat a lot of enemies and the floor starts to get filled with
  items, they will start disappearing, starting from the most worthless ones.'

***** <Object_param>
=== Equipment Notation (Basics) ===

Keine - 'Now, let's say you found a piece of equipment and identified it.
But you probably won't quite understand what's written there if you look at
it for the first time.
I'll explain how to read it.

First of all, melee weapons.

        Claymore (2d8) (+4, +3)

Claymore is the weapon's name. The (2d8) after it is the weapon base power;
it means 'roll 2 8-sided dice'. If you're wondering why it's suddenly using
dice rolls, that's because it uses mechanics of old tabletop RPGs.

The average value of the dice roll is calculated using following formula:

(dice sides + 1) * dice amount / 2

For 2d8, the average value is 9.
The (+4, +3) after that is (accuracy modifier, damage modifier).
If you attack with this sword, you get +4 to accuracy and deal 12 damage on
average if you land a hit.
Also, that doesn't mean your accuracy is increased by 4%. Accuracy
calculations are very complicated and we won't be examining them.

Next up is ranged weapons.

        Long Bow (x3) (+4, +5)
        Steel Arrow (3d4) (+6, +4) (49/98)

The (x3) is the bow's strength - the multiplier applied to arrow damage. The
higher it is, the more powerful the bow is.
(49/98) doesn't show unless you're holding an appropriate ranged weapon.
49 on the left side is damage for one shot. Expected value for (3d4) is 7.5;
with damage modifiers applied, it's 16.5, and with the x3 multiplier, it's 49.
98 on the right side is the expected damage per turn. You can shoot several
times per turn. Amount of shots for ranged weapons will be covered in more
details in Combat Mechanics section.

Next up is armor.

        Partial Plate Armor (-3) [21, +7]

(-3) is short for (-3, 0) - it applies a -3 accuracy modifier to your attacks.
Heavy armor obstructs your movements.
[21, +7] is armor class. 21 is the base value, +7 is armor modifier value.
The higher your armor class is, the more easily you can avoid monster melee
attacks, and it can reduce damage you receive if you get hit.
However, damage from special melee attacks (like 'burn' or 'poison') is not
reduced by armor class.

Next up is ego-item armor.
	
	O-yoroi of Oni (-3) [36, +18] (+3) {+St;rAcElFiCoWa(St}

Do you see the (+3) after the armor class value?
This isn't an accuracy or damage modifier, this is a stat modifier.
In this armor's case, wearing it gives you +3 to strength. Also, wearing it
gives you resistance to several elements.
It's all mentioned in the {} brackets; we'll cover reading this description
a bit later.'

***** <Magic_weapon>
=== Weapon Special Effects ===

Keine - 'If you're a complete newcomer, feel free to skip this section and
return to it later, once you've gotten used to adventuring.

Let's go over special effects on your equipment.
The text in () brackets is automatically written down in {} brackets once
you've *identified* the item.
Let's start with weapon special effects.

- Elemental brands (|Ac, |El, |Fi, |Co, |Po)
  There are five kinds of elemental weapon brands - acid, lightning, fire,
  cold, and poison. When you attack with a branded weapon, you deal large
  damage if the enemy doesn't resist that element.

  To be more specific, it multiplies the dice part by 2.5.
  For example, if you attack with a (3d5) (0, +10) {|Fi} weapon, the 
  expected damage against a fire resistant enemy is 19, but against an enemy
  lacking that resistance it's 32.5.

- Slays (/Ch, /Lw, /An, /Hm, /Un, /Dr, /Dt, /Dm, /Yk; might be /X)
  Essentially means 'Weapon of Slay ###'.
  If you attack an enemy of corresponding kind with this weapon, you deal
  large damage.

  /Ch deals 2x damage to chaotically aligned beings,
  /Lw deals 2x damage to lawfully aligned beings,
  /An deals 2.5x damage to animals,
  /Hm deals 2.5x damage to humans and 2x to humanoids,
  /Ud deals 3x damage to undead,
  /Dr deals 3x damage to dragons,
  /Dt deals 3x damage to deities,
  /Dm deals 3x damage to demons,
  /Yk deals 3x damage to youkai.

  Those multipliers apply to the weapon's dice value.
  There are also effects like /XHm that deal even more damage to those
  enemies.

  If your weapon has several brands/slays that are effective against the
  enemy you're attacking, only the highest multiplier will be applied.

- Sharpness (|Shp, or |XShp)
  Sharp-edged weapons. Can only be applied to edged weapons.
  If you attack with this weapon, you might cut deeply into your opponent,
  dealing more damage. Detailed calculations are somewhat complex, but on
  average, it multiplies the dice value by 1.22.
  There also very rare, extremely sharp weapons denoted with |XShp.
  They multiply dice value by 1.67 on average.
  Sharpness dice multiplier stacks with brand/slay dice multipliers.

- Force (|Mn)
  A weapon that can deliver powerful strikes using the wielder's spiritual
  power. If you attack with this weapon, dice value will be multiplied by
  (brand/slay multiplier * 1.5 + 2).
  This effect stacks with brand/slay and sharpness modifiers.
  However, your MP decreases when you attack with force weapons.
  If your MP runs out, this effect no longer applies.
  
  Effectively, dice value ends up being modified by [highest applicable
  brand/slay multiplier] * [force multiplier] * [sharpness multiplier].
  Here's an example:
  |Mn alone multiplies by 3.5,
  /Yk|Mn multiplies by 6.5 when attacking a youkai,
  /XDr|Mn|XShp multiplies by an astounding 16 when attacking a dragon!

- Earthquakes (|Qk)
  A weapon that causes earthquakes when you attack with it. Can only be
  applied to non-edged weapons.
  When an earthquake happens, the dungeon breaks down, altering the terrain,
  and falling rocks might deal damage to enemies. However, if holes open up in
  walls, new enemies might enter the fight, and you might not be able to
  obtain items from the enemies you've defeated.
  To be honest, it's not an useful ability.

- Chaotic (|Ch)
  An ominous weapon with powers of chaos residing in it. Don't confuse it 
  with /Ch, which deals more damage to chaotically aligned beings.
  When you attack with this weapon, some weird things may occur. You might
  drain HP from the enemy, confuse them, teleport them, polymorph them, or
  cause an earthquake.
  The first two effects are fine, the last three aren't that pleasant.

- Vampiric (|Vmp)
  A bloodthirsty weapon.
  When you attack a living being with this weapon, you drain a slight amount
  of HP from them. It's a very useful weapon that boosts your long-term combat
  capability. However, it's harder to use from midgame, where many nonliving
  demons and undead start to appear.

- Suitable for throwing (Th)
  It's either in a shape that makes it easier to throw, or is enchanted with
  some spell. If you throw this weapon, you deal more damage compared to
  throwing a usual weapon.
  Artifacts suited for throwing deal even more damage.

- Comes back when thrown (Bm)
  There are weapon that return to your hand after being thrown. Thor's hammer
  is well known for that ability. However, it might not come back, or you
  might fail to catch it, and it'll drop at your feet. Having high dexterity
  makes you less likely to feel.

Now, let's look over ranged weapons:

- Powerful shots (Xm)
  Ammo shot from this bow/crossbow hits harder than usual.
  The weapon's multiplier (like x3) gets raised by 1.

- Extra shots (Xs)
  You can shoot faster using this bow/crossbow.
  It's useful, since it both increases your damage and makes you able to fight
  in a more safe way.

That's about it for special effects on weapons.'

***** <Resist>
=== Elemental Resistances ===

Keine - 'Next, I'll explain resistances to various elements.
Several races and classes can have some innate resistances, but they're
mainly obtained through equipment.

- Acid resistance (rAc)      Acid immunity (*Ac)
- Lightning resistance (rEl) Lightning immunity (*El)
- Fire resistance (rFi)      Fire immunity (*Fi)
- Cold resistance (rCo)      Cold immunity (*Co)

  Acid, lightning, fire and cold are called basic elements.
  Having a resistance to one of them reduces damage you receive from 
  it to 1/3.

  If you have immunity to an element, you take zero damage from it,
  and your items are completely protected from damage.

  Basic element attacks can deal massive damage in a single attack.
  For example, Great Lava Wyrms deal 1600 damage with their fire breath if you
  don't resist it. You want at least rFire by dungeon level 20, and the rest
  of basic element resistances by dungeon level 35.

  Now, here's an important detail, so remember it well. If you already
  resist a basic element or poison and then gain temporary resistance on top
  of it (for example, from a potion), you will take only 1/9 damage from that
  element.
  This is called double resistance.
  Wearing several pieces of equipment with the same resistance does nothing -
  it will still count as only one layer of damage reduction.

The elements below are also called 'higher elements'; there's a lot of them.
You should avoid fighting enemies that use elemental attack you don't resist.
You can use probing to determine what kind of special abilities your enemies
have; if you haven't gotten used to adventuring yet, I suggest carrying a
Staff or Rod of Probing with you.
White Wolf Tengu, Maids/Butlers, Rangers and other races/classes have special
abilities with similar effect.

- Poison resistance (rPo)
  Reduces poison damage to 1/3. Also prevents you from being poisoned.
  Hard to cover compared to basic element resistances, but you want to have it
  by dungeon level 40.
  I've already said it, but just like with basic elements, poison element
  damage gets reduces to 1/9 if you double resist it.

- Light resistance (rLi)
  Reduces light element damage to 4/(7+1d4). Also prevents you from being
  blinded by light element attacks.
  Gensouband has several new enemies using light element attacks; if you don't
  have it covered by midgame, watch out for shrine maidens and spellcasters.

- Darkness resistance (rDk)
  Reducess darkness damage to 4/(7+1d4). Also prevents you from being blinded
  by darkness attacks, and reduces damage from some curse attacks.
  There's not a lot of enemies that use darkness attacks, but those who do
  tend to be comparatively dangerous.

- Shards resistance (rSh)
  Reduces shards damage to 6/(7+1d4), and halves damage from rocket attacks.
  Also prevents you from being wounded by shards attacks.
  Does pretty much nothing in early game, but you absolutely want to have it
  covered on lower levels.

- Sound resistance (rSo)
  Reduces sound damage to 5/(7+1d4). Also prevents you from being stunned by
  sound attacks and other elements like rockets/ice/etc.
  It's good to have it, but it's not that high priority.

- Nether resistance (rNt)
  Reduces nether damage to 6/(7+1d4), and reduces damage from some curse
  attacks as well. Also reduces experience drained by draining attacks.
  Demon and undead enemies frequently use nether element attacks, so you want
  to have it covered by midgame.

- Chaos resistance (rCa)
  Reduces chaos damage to 6/(7+1d4). Also prevents you from gaining mutations
  from chaos attacks, and from hallucinating.
  It's a resistance you want to constantly have covered by midgame.

- Water resistance (rWa)
  Halves damage from water attacks. Also prevents you from being stunned by
  water attacks, and prevents your items from being destroyed.
  If you enter water terrain while carrying too much, you won't drown.
  Useful in early game, but you'll probably do fine without it in endgame.

- Disenchantment resistance (rDi)
  Reduces disenchantment damage to 6/(7+1d4). Also prevents your equipment
  from being disenchanted.
  I wouldn't say it's necessary, but you have to be very careful past midgame
  if you don't have it.

- Holy resistance (rHo)
  Halves damage from holy element attacks. Enemies using this element
  frequently appear all the way from early game to endgame, so if you're
  vulnerable to it (for example, you're a youkai or you study Necromancy),
  you want to cover it as soon as possible.
  However, it's hard to find items that grant this resistance.

- Space-time resistance (rTi)
  Has a chance to protect you from enemies teleporting you away.
  Reduces gravity damage to 4/(7+1d4) and prevents teleportation and item
  destruction.
  Reduces time damage to 4/(7+1d4) and prevents stat/experience drain.
  Reduces spacial distortion damage to 4/(7+1d4) and prevents stat drain
  and teleportation.
  Reduces nexus damage to 6/(7+1d4) and prevent various additional effects.
  It's a useful resistance that protects you from various attacks.
  However, items that grant this resistance are very rare.
  Fortunately, even without this resistance, all those attacks aside from
  nexus don't deal that much damage.

The following effects protect you from status abnormalities:

- Free action (Fa)
  Protects from paralysis/sleep.
  If you become paralysed, you generally will keep getting attacked for a
  several turns. That effectively means a game over.
  Make absolutely sure to have it covered beyond dungeon level 20, and never
  take it off.

- Fear resistance (Fe)
  Protects you from being terrified.
  While terrified, you cannot attack enemies in melee, and your ranged
  accuracy and spell success rate go down.
  If you don't have this resistance, you can use alcohol, spells or potions
  to make yourself heroic, protecting you from this condition.

- Blindness resistance (Bl)
  Protects you from being blinded.
  While blind, you cannot see terrain or enemies, and cannot use scrolls or
  spellbooks. You can cure it with Potions of Cure Serious Wounds, but
  depending on the situation, taking that extra action might be too risky.

- Confusion resistance (Co)
  Protects you from being confused.
  While confused, you move in random directions and cannot use spells or
  scrolls. Magic devices also have a high chance to fail.
  You can cure it with Potions of Cure Serious Wounds, but there are many
  enemies that can confuse with melee attacks.
  Getting close to them without this resistance is extremely dangerous.
  You want to get it covered before midgame.

- Insanity resistance (In)
  Protects you from being terrified by cosmic horrors.
  Without this resistance, you'll frequently get mentally shocked on lower
  levels. Some enemies can use a very powerful mental attack that you can't
  protect yourself against without having this resistance.
  If you receive brain trauma, you can cure it at Eientei.
  Unfortunately, items that grant this resistance are fairly rare.

That's about it.
I've already said this, but avoid fighting enemies that can use elemental
attack you don't resist.'

=== Parameter Raising Effects ===

Keine - 'Now we'll cover effects that raise your parameters.
Let's remember the parameters explained at the point of character creation.

- Strength (+St)
- Intelligence (+In)
- Wisdom (+Wi)
- Dexterity (+Dx)
- Constitution (+Cn)
- Charisma (+Ch)
  Effects that raise your primary stats. Constitution in particular is very
  important.

- Stealth (+Sl)
  Raises your stealth skill.
  If you're around 'Heroic', you should be able to comfortably infiltrate
  vaults.

- Speed (+Sp)
  Raises your action speed.
  You probably won't be able to find it in early game; on lower levels, you
  want around +20 in total.

- Magic Device Mastery (+Md)
  Raises your magic device skill.
  Pure warrior classes won't be able to properly use powerful magic devices
  without using this equipment.

- Digging (+Dg)
  Has little meaning aside from when you're using a pick in early game.
  Can only be applied to weapons.

- Infravision (+If)
  Ability to detect warm-blooded creatures.
  Has some use in early game, but you'll have to use proper means of detection
  starting from midgame.

- Searching (+Sr)
  Raises your searching skill. Helps you detect traps and hidden doors and 
  sense level feelings. In Gensouband, it also affects generation rate for 
  materials; it can be very important depending on your class.

- Extra Attacks (+At)
  Increases amount of melee attacks per round.
  Mostly appears on weapons and rings.

- Protection from Magic (+PrMg)
  Increases protection from magic, making it easier to resist attacks like
  curses and mind blasts.

- Disarming (+Dsrm)
  Increases your trap disarming skill.

That's about it for parameters.'

***** <Misc>
=== Other Effects ===

Keine - 'Well, now that we've covered weapon effects, resistances and
parameters, let's take a look at remaining effects that don't belong in any
of those categories.

- Telepathy (~Tele)
  Useful means of detection that lets you constantly sense nearby enemies.
  However, it can't detect nonliving or mindless beings.

- ESP (~Chs, ~Law, ~An, ~Hm, ~Un, ~Dr, ~Dt, ~Dm, ~Yk, ~Nolv, ~Uniq)
  Lets you constantly sense beings of a specific kind.
  'Nolv' stands for non-living beings.

- Stat sustaining ( (St, (In, (Wi, (Dx, (Cn, (Ch )
  Prevents your stats from being drained by various means, like enemy attacks.
  Each of them protects a specific stat.

- Easy spellcasting (Es)
- Decreased mana cost (Dm)
  Slightly reduces spell failure rate/MP cost. Either of those is great for
  spellcasters.

- Reflection (Rf)
  Reflection bolt spells from enemies, sending them back.
  Might occasionally fail to reflect, so don't get overconfident.
  It's a very useful ability in this mod, since there are many enemies that
  fire danmaku. Very hard to obtain in early game.

- Levitation (Lv)
  Makes you able to fly, sort of.
  Allows you to cross water terrain, pit, mountains and trapdoors, and reduces
  damage received from tornado and gravity attacks.
  You want to have it when going to Tengu Village or Former Hell.

- See invisible (Si)
  Lets you see invisible enemies.
  You want to have it by around dungeon level 20 if possible.

- Regeneration (Rg)
  Doubles your natural HP/MP regeneration rate.
  Convenient, but it also increases your hunger rate as well, so be careful
  on long journeys.

- Slow digestion (Sd)
  Reduces your hunger rate.
  If you are in trouble without it, you should plan your journey more
  carefully.

- Light source (Lu)
  This item glows brightly, increasing your light radius by 1.

- Warning (Wr)
  If you have this, when you try moving into a trap or moving into a
  situation where you might receive large damage, it will vibrate, warning
  you of danger.
  Convenient, because it reduces the need for trap detection.
  If you cancel your action due to warning, you still consume a slight amount
  of energy.

- Blessed (Bs)
  This piece of equipment can't be cursed.
  If you're a Shrine Maiden/Oracle, you might have some equipment restrictions
  related to this effect.
  If you're a Defender, it gives you an attack power bonus.

- Teleportation (Te)
  If you're using this piece of equipment, you will be able to pursue nearby
  enemies that teleport away. However, it's not very reliable.
  Also, if this item becomes cursed, you will start teleporting at random.

- Dual-wielding (To)
  Can only be applied to handwear. If you're wearing it, your accuracy penalty
  for dual-wield is reduced.

- Swift movement (Sw)
  Raises your movement speed by a factor of up to 2 (depending on your level).
  Useful, but hard to obtain.

- Auras ( [F, [C, [E )
  If you're using this equipment, when an enemy hits you in melee, they will
  receive slight damage of corresponding element.
  It doesn't do much to powerful enemies, though.
  Also, fire aura increases your light radius by 1.

- Anti-magic ([M)
  Drastically increases your protection from magic, but makes you unable to
  use magic. It doesn't apply just to spellbooks - it includes special
  abilities that are close enough to magic.
  Usually, it's used by pure warriors only, but the raised protection from
  magic can protect you from being paralysed by Ancient Foul Curse - keep
  that in mind.

- Anti-teleportation ([T)
  Makes you unable to teleport.
  While it prevents you from being teleported away by enemy spells, the
  demerit is very severe.

That's about it.
Searching for a set of equipment that provides both necessary resistances and
parameter bonuses is one of key points of this game. It's frequently called
'Resistance puzzle'.'

***** <Inscriptions>
=== Item Inscriptions ===

Keine - 'You can inscribe items with '{' command.
You can enter whatever you want, to make a note of sorts.
However, you're not limited to taking notes.
If you inscribe various special formula, it can make various actions in your
adventure far more effective.

In this regard, not much has changed from original Hengband, so I'm using
the original help file. If you don't understand it, feel free to skip it.
Come back to it once you've gotten used to adventuring and want to raise your
efficiency.'

---------------------------------Quoted below---------------------------------

You may "inscribe" any object with a textual inscription of your
choice. These inscriptions are not limited in length, though you may
not be able to see the whole inscription on the item. The game applies
special meaning to inscriptions containing any text of the form "@#" or
"@x#" or "!x" or "!*".

The game provides some "fake" inscriptions to help you keep track of
your possessions. Wands and staves which are known to be empty will be
inscribed with "empty". Objects which have been tried at least once but
haven't been identified yet will be inscribed with "tried". Cursed
objects are inscribed with "cursed". Broken objects may be inscribed
with "broken". Also, any item which was purchased at a discount,
implying that it is slightly "sub-standard", will be inscribed with the
appropriate "discount", such as "25% off". Note that these inscriptions
are fake, and cannot be removed, though they can be covered up by a
real inscription if you so desire. Try "_" as a nice short one. 

--- Making use of Inscriptions ---

Some players use the inscription feature to record useful and/or
interesting facts about an object such as where and how it was
acquired or what its abilities and powers are. Hengband have a feature
to automatically inscribe abilities of items for you.

In addition to this, inscriptions can be used in far more powerful
ways. Many commands in Hengband require you to specify an object from
your inventory such as which potion you wish to 'q'uaff or which staff
you wish to 'u'se.  Inscriptions offer a powerful way of managing this
and provide a useful labor saving tool.


Auto Inscription of Resistances and Powers
------------------------------------------

When you inscribe {%all} on an *identified* object, the '%all' will
automatically transforms and changes into a string which describe its
resistances and powers.  For example, when you inscribe {%all} on a
robe of Resistance which has resistance to four elements and an extra
resistance to Nether, the inscription will change into {AcElFiClNt}.
The 'Ac' is abbreviation of resistance to ACid, while El, Fi, Cl and
Nt are resistances to ELectricity, FIre, CoLd and NeTher.

On the other hand, when you inscribe {%} on an *identified* object,
the {%} will transform to a string which describes only its extra
resistances. In the example above, the inscription will become {Nt},
meaning the extra resistance of Nether.


The {@x#} Inscription
---------------------

The {@x#} inscription (where 'x' is the key to activate a specific
command and '#' is an object tag (number or alphabet)) is, perhaps the
most commonly used inscription. When you select command 'x', followed
by the tag '#', the game searches for an object with the inscription
{@x#} and performs that command upon it. Thus if the player inscribes
a Potion of Healing as {@q1}, then pressing 'q1' will quaff it
automatically. This feature is useful because as items are added or
removed from your inventory, the actual slot that they are in
changes. However, the inscription will work regardless of the
position.

Note that you can inscribe multiple different objects with the same
inscription {@x#}. If you do so, the command 'x#' will act on the first
appropriately inscribed object in your inventory list and not on each
of them.

Also note that you can place multiple such inscriptions on a single
object. So that a spell book might be inscribed {@ma@ba@Ga} since the
cast spell, browse book, and gain spell commands each require a spell
book reference as an argument. You can also inscribe the same command
more than one so that food item might be inscribed {@E1@E2}

Example 1:
    You have a primary weapon and a shovel. You normally use the
    weapon but want to use the shovel for mining treasure. Inscribe
    your primary weapon with {@w0} and your shovel with {@w1}. Then,
    when you want to wield your shovel, you can press 'w1' and to
    re-wield your sword you can press 'w0' regardless of where in the
    inventory they are located at the time.

    Note: you can also inscribe both weapons with {@w0} and just press
    'w0' whenever you want to exchange weapon and shovel.

Example 2:

    To cast the first spell from your first spell book, you would
    normally type 'maa' and to cast the first spell from the second
    book, you would type 'mba'.  However, if your first book is stolen
    or destroyed, pressing 'mba' would no longer cast the spell you
    wanted. People often cast the wrong spells in such situation.  To
    prevent such mistake, you can inscribe your first spellbook with
    {@ma}, second spellbook with {@mb}, etc.  Cast spells by typing
    'maa', 'mba', etc.  Even if your other spell books are lost, you
    will never need to worry about casting the wrong spell.

Example 3:
    You are carrying some Rations of Food and some Elvish Waybread.
    You wish to use up the Rations first before eating the Waybread,
    but also want to be able to use the healing/curing properties of
    the Waybread in an emergency. You would inscribe the Rations with
    {@E1} and the Waybread with {@E1@E2}. Since the Rations appear
    before the Waybread on the inventory listing, typing 'E1' will
    ensure you eat all the Rations first before touching the Waybread
    but that you only ever have to press E1 to eat. But, pressing 'E2'
    will bypass the Rations and jump to the Waybread. Some players also
    do similar things with cure and healing potions. 


The {@#} Inscription
---------------------

The {@#} inscription (where '#' is a number from 0 to 9) is similar to
the {@x#} inscription, but it works for any command, and any alphabet
letters cannot be used as a tag.


The {!x} Inscription
--------------------
The {!x} inscription (where 'x' is the key to activate a specific
command) will induce "verification" whenever that object is "selected".
Thus, inscribing {!v!k!d} on an object will greatly reduce the odds of
you "losing" it by accident. This is because any attempt to throw it
('f'), destroy it ('k') or drop it ('d') will prompt Hengband to verify
whether or not you really wish to take that action.  

Note that inscribing {!*} on an object will prompt Hengband to verify
any action thus you allowing you to be very paranoid about the object.
Also note that "selling" and "dropping" both use the "d" command so
that inscribing an item with {!d} will also prevent you from selling it
by accident.


The {^x} Inscription
--------------------
The {^x} inscription (where 'x' is the key to activate a specific
command) will induce verification before taking that action. One
common example of its usage is to inscribe boots with {^<^>} which will
verify the user's command to leave the level via the staircases before
actually doing so.


The {=g} Inscription
--------------------
The {=g} inscription on an object prompts Hengband to automatically
pick it up. This instruction overrides any auto-pickup options chosen
chosen by the player (if necessary). The primary purpose is to allow
easy retrieval of missiles such as arrows and bolts once they have been
fired at a target. 


The {#anystring} Inscription
--------------------

The {#anystring} inscription is used to make an item look like an
artifact. For example, a Long Sword (2d5) (+10,+10) which is inscribed
as {#of Hoge} is displayed as 'a Long Sword of Hoge (2d5) (+10,+10)'.


The {!!} Inscription
--------------------

The {!!} Inscription on a rod or artifact tells the game to report you
when the object is recharged and became activatable again.


The {.} Inscription
--------------------

The {.} Inscription on a equipment which has ability of random
teleportaion prevents the game from asking you whether you want to
teleport or not on random chance, and the game automatically decide
not to teleport.  But the ability of random teleportation has another
function which allows you to follow a teleporting monster; this
function will not be disabled.


The {$} Inscription
--------------------

The {$} Inscription on a equipment which has ability of warning
completely disables the warning ability.
