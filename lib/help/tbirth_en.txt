=== Character Creation ===

Keine - 'Before you start your adventure, there's something you need to do.
What race are you? What class are you? What stats do you have?
How difficult your quest is going to be? Let's answer those questions.'

***** <Difficulty>
=== Difficulty Level ===

Keine - 'First of all, let's pick the difficulty level of your quest.
The difficulties are Easy, Normal, Hard, Lunatic and Extra.
Here's more detailed description:

  "Easy" is a simple mode for training.
You are unnaturally strong, your enemies are weak; your quest will be easy.
Also, even if you get defeated, you still can continue. Feel free to pick
this difficulty level if you're a complete newcomer. 
By the way, once you defeat Yukari Yakumo at dungeon level 50 in this mode, 
you've cleared the game. You can't go any further. Also, your score will be
extremely lowered.

  "Normal" is normal mode. That being said, it's notably easier compared
to Hengband. Enemy health is only 75% of the original. Also, enemies cannot
cast spells or use breath attacks several times in a row without giving you
a turn. You're free to attack without worrying too much about what elements
you're vulnerable to.
Once you defeat Yukari Yakumo in this mode, it counts as you having cleared
the game, but you still can go further on. If you play carefully enough, you
should clear this difficulty with comparative ease.

  "Hard" is, more or less, around the same level as Hengband.
Enemies learn what elements are effective against you and won't use
ineffective attacks. You also might get hit by multiple powerful attacks in
a row from a fast-moving enemy. There also will be strong enemies that easily
can defeat you in no time if you're careless.
Score is doubled compared to Normal.

  "Lunatic" is close the the 'Nightmare Mode' from Hengband.
All enemies get +5 to speed, and their health is doubled, with an upper limit
of 30000. They always start out awake and know all of your vulnerabilities
from the start. That's not all; powerful enemies might be lurking around
early dungeon levels. If you run into one, start praying.

On top of that, bad things can happen at midnight.
If you sleep at an inn, you see insanity-inducing nightmares.
Stat sustaining abilities won't always work, and stat drain might end up
being permanent.
Mutations can occasionally be incurable.
You are more likely to get caught off-guard by summoned enemies or being
ambushed.
If you dig up dungeon walls, you may cause a cave-in.
Maintenance cost for followers is doubled.

Feel free to try if you've gotten used to the game and miss getting defeated
in completely unreasonable ways. Score is multiplied eight times compared to
Normal difficulty.

  "Extra" is an extremely special game mode with its own unique rules.
Explaining it would take too long, so we'll do it somewhere else. Handling
consumables and equipment will be far more important in this mode; it's a
difficulty you can attempt after clearing Hard mode several times.
Score is quadrupled compared to Normal difficulty.'


***** <Status_main>
=== Primary Stats ===

Keine - 'Next, you'll have to pick your race and class, but let's take a look
at your stats first. You can say they're the statistics representing your
abilities.

We'll start with the 6 primary stats:
Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.
Their interpretation and role have changed slightly from Hengband.

- "Strength" is your physical strength.
It affects your combat attack power, equipment weight you're comfortable with,
amount of weapon attacks per round, and how much weight you can comfortably
carry around.
Of course, it's important for warriors, but since your spell MP cost gets
higher if you're wearing too heavy equipment, mages can't neglect it either.

- "Intelligence" represents how smart are you and how good is your memory.
It affects spell failure rate, amount of spells you can learn, success rate
for magic devices and so on.
It's very important for spellcasters, and warriors might not need it as much.
In contrast to Hengband, 'priestly' classes like Shrine Maidens still use 
Intelligence to calculate spell failure rate.

- "Wisdom" is your spiritual power and faith.
It affects amount of MP and protection from magic.
It's not that important for pure warriors, but other classes will need it.
In particular, it's directly linked to combat capability for pure mages.

- "Dexterity" is both your manual dexterity and agility in general.
It affects armor class, amount of weapon attack per round, disarming skill,
and so on.
It's important for warrior classes, but spellcasters don't need it as much.
If it's too low, you might end up crying after a thief steals something
important from you.

- "Constitution" is your physical sturdiness.
It affects your HP and how quickly you recover from status abnormalities.
Naturally, it's important for warriors, but it's vital for spellcasters as
well. Past midgame, you'll be in danger unless you have enough HP left;
this is a stat you can't neglect.

- "Charisma" is your attractiveness and popularity.
It mainly affects buying/selling prices in stores. If your charisma is low,
you might have trouble getting enough money.
Also, the unique classes we'll talk about later on have many special
abilities that increase in power depending on your charisma.
After all, "Danmaku is a contest of beauty".

Those stats will occasionally increase as you level up.
They also might increase if you drink a magical potion.
Maximum stat value, without taking race/class/personality/equipment
modifiers into account, is 30.
With those modifiers, the maximum is 40; there are some special ways to
temporarily increase them up to 50.

By the way, in original Hengband, stats beyond 18 were shown as, for example,
'18/40'; they went up to '18/***', never reaching 19.

It was a reference to D&D setting that '19 is reserved for gods', but
there already are gods in Gensoukyou, so...'

***** <Status_other>
=== Other Parameters ===

Keine - 'Next, let's talk about parameters other than primary stats.
If you're a complete newcomer, feel free to skip this.
Come back once you've reached around dungeon level 30.

- "Stealth" is the ability to avoid waking up enemies.
If your stealth is low, nearby enemies will keep waking up and coming
after you, likely making dungeon exploration harder.
Stealth is affected by your race, class and equipment.
There are very few classes that increase stealth as they level up.

- "Speed" is the ability to act quickly. +10 makes you act twice as often,
+20 makes you act three times as often.
It doesn't affect just your movement, it affects all actions you perform.
It's very important when going against powerful enemies.
Equipment with speed bonus will be mainly available post midgame, in early
game you can temporarily increase your speed with something like 
'Potion of Speed'.
Once you go very deep into the dungeon, you want speed of at least +20.
Once you reach +30, raising it further won't have much effect.

- "Infravision" is the ability to see warm-blooded living beings in
darkness. +1 to infravision lets you see enemies from distance of 10 feet, 
or one grid on the screen.
It's somewhat useful in early game, but past midgame there will be many
cold-blooded enemies like demons and undead.
You'll have to get other means of sensing enemies like telepathy by then.

- "Tunneling" is the ability to dig through walls. The higher it is, the
faster you dig up walls.
In order to dig up treasures buried in walls, you have to raise this parameter
by, for example, wielding a digging tool.
Past midgame, it's not going to be very useful unless it's high enough.

- "Searching" is the ability to discover hidden things.
If it is high, you'll have easier time discovering traps and hidden doors,
and you'll be able to quicker get a general feeling about the level.
Also, you'll find more special items (like materials) in dungeons.
You can't have too much of Searching, but you shouldn't be too concerned
with having low Searching either.
It's going to be more important on Extra difficulty.

- "Magic Devices" is the ability to use magic devices.
It affects your success rate of using staves/wands/rods or activating
equipped items.
It's not that important in early game, but becomes a very vital parameter
at endgame. Deep in the dungeon, no matter how strong you are, you always
might run into enemies you can't handle; you need powerful magic devices
like Staves of *Destruction* or Staves of Healing.
Pure warriors aren't good at this, so you'll need to raise this skill with 
equipment.

- "Protection from Magic" (also can be called "Saving Throw") represents
your resistance to magic.
It doesn't protect you from magic in general, though; it lets you resist
effects like 'curse' or 'mental attack'/'mind blasting'.
If you manage to resist the effect, you take no damage.
There will be many powerful attacks past midgame, so you never can have
enough of this skill.
Its value mainly depends on you race, class, level, and wisdom.
Some equipment can raise your protection from magic, and being temporarily
'blessed' will raise it as well.
Equipment with 'anti-magic' also boosts it, but it makes you unable to use
magic yourself.

- "Disarming" is the ability to disarm traps and unlock doors.
Mainly depends on your race, class, level and dexterity. Some equipment can
raise your disarming skill.
However, it's not that useful past midgame. It's faster and safer to disarm
using magic devices.

- "Fighting" is your skill at martial arts and weapon combat.
It affects your accuracy, indirectly increasing attack power.
It is mainly dependent on your class and level, but in early game you can't
ignore your racial modifier as well.
Oni and vampires are good at it, magicians and inchlings aren't.

- "Shooting" is your skill at shooting or throwing.
It also affects your accuracy and mainly depends on your class and level.

- "HP" should be obvious. Once you go below zero, it's game over.
Amount of HP depends on your constitution, race and class.
An oni and an inchling of the same level, class and constitution
will have very different amounts of HP.

- "MP" should be obvious as well. You can't cast spells if you don't have
enough.
Amount of MP depends mainly on level, class, and wisdom. Your race and class
wisdom modifier also affects it somewhat.
Spells usually use MP, but some class special abilities might use HP instead.
Racial powers mainly use MP; if you don't have enough, they use HP as well.
Even warriors have a bit of MP, but they probably aren't going to use it
unless wielding a 'force-branded' weapon.
Spells, special abilities and racial powers will be covered in details
later on.

- "Experience" should sound familiar. It is required to raise your level.
In-game, this value is called both 'experience' and 'life force'.
It's a bit hard to interpret; think of it as you like.
It can temporarily decrease if you get hit by nether element attacks or 
attacked by undead.
If you drink a Potion of Restore Life Levels, it will return to normal.

- "AC" is short for Armor Class. The higher it is, the less likely you are
to get hit by enemy melee attacks. Its effect becomes less noticeable once
you go past 150.

Those are your parameters.
You can check those values with 'C' command.'

***** <Race>
=== Races ===

Keine - 'Various beings live in Gensoukyou.
At this point, pick which race you are.
Race greatly affects your stats, class aptitude, and resistance to enemy 
attacks. If you're not used to adventuring, pick a powerful race that gains
levels slowly like Oni, Great-Youkai or Celestial.
Races with good hearing like Beastman or Moon-Rabbit can detect enemies.
Humans, Fairies and Inchlings have low stats, and races like Vampires or
Youkai-Dolls have very specific games, so it's probably to leave them for
later until you get used to the game.
That being said, you also can have fun by picking the one you like the most
without thinking too much about it.

Races will be explored in more details later on.'

***** <Class>
=== Classes ===

Keine - 'Picking your class is very important.
Different classes can have completely different strategies for clearing the
dungeon.

For warrior classes, you need a good weapon and high enough strength, 
dexterity and constitution. In early game, you'll be able to deal with most 
of the enemies by hitting them, but it'll be tough past midgame once enemies
start using various special attacks.

Spellcaster classes require high intelligence and wisdom, and they fight
by using many spells. You have to properly assess the situation by observing
both your and enemy strength. You'll get plenty of tools to deal with various
situations past midgame, but you'll have to get used to properly utilizing
them.

There also are classes competent both with weapon combat and spellcasting,
and some classes have their own special way of combat. If you're not that
experienced, pick a warrior class like Warrior or Marksman.

Classes will be explored in more details later on.

Race/class characteristics are roughly described at the point you pick them.
By pressing '~' during game and picking 'About yourself' you can check
them again.'

***** <UniqueClass>
=== What are Unique Classes? ===

Keine - 'There are other special classes specific to Gensouband.
They're the girls of Gensoukyou known due to many incidents.
If you're one of them, say your name.
They have their own special class, and their race, gender and name are fixed.
Those classes have their own parameters, magic realms, special abilities and
other unique characteristics; they're generally called 'unique classes'.
There are over 100 unique classes right now, and the amount is going to
increase as new Touhou Project material comes out.'

***** <Outsider>
=== Who are Outsiders? ===

Keine - 'What? How did you get here without having heard of Gensoukyou?
Right, you're an human who came here from the Outside World?

It'd be the best for you to just come back alive; go to south-east from the
Human Village to the Hakurei Shrine.
The shrine maiden, Reimu Hakurei, will send you back outside if you ask her.
Just don't even think of getting involved in the incident, okay?'

***** <Personality>
=== Personality ===

Keine - 'You might be calculating or you might be quick to pick a fight.
Personalities like this slightly affect your parameters. Well, pick the one
you like.
The 'Munchkin' personality ridiculously powers you up in all aspects; think
of it as a training mode.

Several unique classes can choose a specific unique personality, which can
significantly change their parameters and special abilities.

There also are some other obviously weird personalities, but I can't recommend
them to new players.'

***** <Realm>
=== Choosing your Magic Realm ===

Keine - 'Several classed can learn spells.
In this context, the 'spells' refers to magic you learn from a spellbook
that you can use with 'm' command when you are carrying that spellbook and
have enough MP.
You can't learn spells unless you reach high enough level, and you will often
fail to cast them properly unless you're smart enough.
There are some other restrictions, but those spells are powerful and diverse.
If you're not an experienced adventurer, classes that don't cast spells will
be easier for you to handle, but you eventually want to learn how to use
spellcasters.

Spells are divided in 3 major realms - Arcane Arts, Hermit Arts, 
and Sorcery Arts.
Arcane Arts has the Elements, Divination, Enchantment and Summoning realms.
Hermit Arts has the Mysticism, Life, Exorcism and Nature realms.
Sorcery Arts has the Transformation, Darkness, Necromancy and Chaos realms.
Each realm has 4 spellbooks - from the 1st volume to the final one, and each
of the spellbooks has 8 spells in it.

Those who are familiar with Hengband probably already understand that,
but Gensouband greatly changes the magic realms.
Chaos is basically the same as Hengband's Chaos realm.
Life and Nature are 50%+ the same as the corresponding Hengband realms.
Summoning resembles Trump realm, Enchantment resembles Craft realm, Exorcism
resemebles Crusade realm.
Many of the other realms have been greatly changed or replaced by new ones.

Out of those 12 realms, you'll be able to study only one of them you choose.
However, several classes like Mage, Teacher, Shrine-Maiden can study 2
realms. You learn spells from your second realm at a slightly slower pace, but
you can change it at any time. However, once you've changed it, you'll forget
all spells you've learned from your previous realm.
There's a limit on how many spells you can learn in total, so I don't
recommend changing your realms without a good reason. Also, if your second
realm belongs to a different major realm than your first, its spells will
be harder for you to cast. Keep that in mind.

Classes have their own aptitudes to the magic realms.
Let's take a look at an Explorer and a Mage studying realm of Elements.
Even if they have the same intelligence, Explorer will have to be at higher
level to learn spells compared to Mage; MP cost will be higher as well,
along with failure rate. And several high-end spells will be simply
unavailable.

Races also have aptitudes, though not to the same extent.
For example, youkai are bad at Hermit Arts but good at Sorcery Arts.
Hermits and Celestial have it the other way around.
Magicians are very good at Arcane Arts, but still can use other realms
with some level of competence.

Version 1.1.08 introduced a 13th realm, 'Occult'.

That's it for the general description.
Magic will be described in more details later on.'


***** <BirthOptions>
=== Birth Options ===

Keine - 'Aside from the game difficulty level,
there are some options you can pick that change the difficulty and add
some restrictions.
If you're on a quest with difficult options set to 'on', your score will be
increased.
By pressing '?', you can view detailed information about a given option.'

***** <BonusPoint>
=== Allocating Bonus Points ===

Keine - 'Your base primary stats depend on the race, class and personality
you picked. You can increase them by allocating bonus points.

Amount of bonus points depends on your luck.
If you don't like it, press 'r' key after finishing allocation to reroll.
It's similar to a certain famous dungeon crawler game, but it's a bit hard
to get a good amount of bonus points here. Getting 25 will be good enough.
If it's annoying, you can use a birth option to set bonus points to a fixed
amount of 20. It also slightly raises your score.'

***** <BackgroundEditor>
=== Background Editor ===

Keine - 'Where were you born, and how were you raised?
And why did you decide to enter the dungeon?
If you wish to express that, write it down here.
Put your thoughts in it.
Once you've written it down, it can't be changed expect for some
*special cases*.'

***** <Name>
=== Name/Class Name ===

Keine - 'Now that we're here, let's hear your name.
If you're an unique class, your name is already known.
If your class is 'Civilian', you can change your class name at this point.
If you started a 'New Game', you also write down your savefile name here.'

***** <QuickStart>
=== Quick Start ===

Keine - 'If you get defeated, you have to start the game over from the
beginning. However, information about character you've created is preserved,
and you can start your new quest in the exact same state you started your
previous one.'
