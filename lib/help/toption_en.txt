=== Options and Effects ===

Most of the "options" are accessible through the '=' command, which
provides an interface to the various "sets" of options available to the
player.

In the descriptions below, each option is listed as the textual summary
which is shown on the "options" screen, plus the internal name of the
option in brackets, followed by a textual description of the option.

Note that the internal name of the option can be used in user pref
files to force the option to a given setting (see pref.txt#Options [a]
for more info).

Various concepts are mentioned in the descriptions below, including
"disturb", (cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands, which
are in progress), "flush" (forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress
queue, including any macros in progress), "fresh" (dump any pending
output to the screen).

***** <Input>
=== Option Set 1 -- Input from keyboard ===

***** <rogue_like_commands>
Rogue-like commands    [rogue_like_commands]
    Selects the "roguelike" command set. 

***** <always_pickup>
Pick things up by default    [always_pickup]
    Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it
    up. Otherwise, you must use the "g" command, or the "-" command
    while walking. Combined with "carry_query_flag", allows you to
    selectively pick up all items which you step on.

***** <carry_query_flag>
Prompt before picking things up    [carry_query_flag]
    Forces the game to ask you if you want to pick something up when
    you do something that would normally cause the item to be picked
    up.

***** <quick_messages>
Activate quick messages    [quick_messages]
    Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the "-more-" prompt
    (useful for monster farming). Allows most keys to mean "no" to any
    "[y/n]" prompt.

***** <auto_more>
Automatically clear '-more-' prompts    [auto_more] 
    The game does not wait for a keypress when it comes to a -more-
    prompt, but carries on going. You'll have to display messages in a
    subwindow or check previous messages with ^P, but it makes playing
    very comfortable. However, since the messages right after receiving
    damage from an enemy are very important and skipping them is
    dangerous, in this case the game will wait for a keypress at -more-
    prompt regardless of this option setting.    

***** <command_menu>
Enable command selection menu    [command_menu]
    If this option is active, pressing Return key will open a unified
    command menu for most of the ingame commands. It's a useful
    option for beginners who haven't learned command keys yet.

***** <other_query_flag>
Prompt for floor item selection    [other_query_flag]
    Forces the game to ask you before select an item on floor.
    Does not ask if easy_floor option is set, because in this
    case pressing '-' will automatically display the list of items
    on floor, requiring a selection.

***** <use_old_target>
Use old target by default    [use_old_target] 
    Forces all commands which normally ask for a "direction" to use the
    current "target" if there is one. Use of this option can be
    dangerous if you target locations on the ground, unless you clear
    them when done.

***** <always_repeat>
Repeat obvious commands    [always_repeat]
    Tells the game that when you attempt to "open" a door or chest,
    "bash" a door, "tunnel" through walls, or "disarm" traps or chests,
    that you wish to "repeat" the command 99 times.

***** <confirm_destroy>
Prompt for destruction of known worthless items    [confirm_destroy]
    Normally, no confirmation will be asked if you attempt to destroy
    an object which you know to be worthless.  If this option is set,
    the Destroy command always asks for confirmation.

***** <confirm_wear>
Confirm to wear/wield known cursed items    [confirm_wear] 
    Some players may occasionally, due to a typing mistake, find
    themselves wearing an item which they knew was cursed. If this
    option is set, you should be safe from such typing mistakes: you
    will be prompted if you attempt to wear or wield an item if your
    character knows it is cursed.

***** <confirm_quest>
Prompt before exiting a quest level    [confirm_quest]
    In the dungeon, you can freely climb up/down stairs and can return
    to former floors normally.  But in some quest levels, including
    random quests, you can not return once you escaped from the level.
    If this option is set, the program asks for confirmation before
    you go up the stairs from such quest levels.

***** <target_pet>
Allow targetting followers    [target_pet]
    Normally, the program doesn't automatically choose followers as 
    target in the targeting mode of attack spells. If this option is 
    set, the program always chooses every monster in sight as target.

    There are some magic items that can haste/heal monsters; those
    always can target your followers regardless of this option. There's
    very little cases for setting this option.

***** <easy_open>
Automatically open doors    [easy_open]
    Makes it easy for your character to open a door: simply by walking
    into it! Also the open command will automatically select one
    direction if only one door is near you. However, if you're able to
    pass through walls, you normally don't have to open doors, so you
    won't automatically open them by walking into them.

***** <easy_disarm>
Automatically disarm traps    [easy_disarm] 
    Makes it easy for your character disarms a trap: simply by walking into
    it! However, you won't disarm traps that can't harm you due to your
    abilities. Also the disarm command will automatically select one
    direction if only one known trap is near you.

***** <easy_floor>
Display floor stacks in a list    [easy_floor]
    Lets you select an item from a stack on the floor by browsing a
    list.  Also the look command will describe floor stack as "You see
    a stack of n items.", when there is more than one item on a floor
    grid, and display a list of items when you press 'x' at that time. 

***** <use_command>
Allow unified use command    [use_command] 
    Unifies the item commands like "zap a rod", "use a staff", "eat
    food", "aim a wand", ... into a general "use object" command. The
    command in the original keymap is "u", and "a" in the roguelike
    mode. The standard commands for eat, quaff, read, zap, aim, ... are
    still available, but can be used for macros. 

***** <over_exert>
Allow casting spells when short of mana    [over_exert]
    If this option is set, if you try to cast a spell while you don't
    have enough MP, and answer 'y' to the confirmation prompt, you
    will attempt to cast the spell regardless. In this case, not only
    your failure rate is very high, but it might drain your constitution
    or paralyse you, making it very dangerous if you accidentally cast
    a spell in this manner. If this option is turned off, you won't be 
    able to do this, and the command will be automatically cancelled if 
    you don't have enough MP.

***** <numpad_as_cursorkey>
Use numpad keys as cursor keys in editor mode    [numpad_as_cursorkey] 
    This option makes numpad keys work as cursor movement keys while
    text editing mode.  Which include auto-picker editor, inputing an
    inscription, a macro action, and etc.


***** <MapScreen>
=== Option set 2 -- Map Screen ===

***** <center_player>
Center map while walking (*slow*)    [center_player]
    The map always centers on the player with this option on. With it off, it
    is divided into 25 sections, with coordinates (0,0) to (4,4), and will 
    show one section at a time.

***** <center_running>
Centering even while running    [center_running]
    Normally, the map does not center on the player if the player
    moves with the "run" command, only when the running finishes.  If
    this option is set, the map always centers on the player. 

***** <view_yellow_lite>
Use special colors for torch-lit grids    [view_yellow_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for "torch-lit" grids
    in certain situations (see the entries for"view_granite_lite" and
    "view_special_lite"). Turning this option off will slightly improve
    game speed.

***** <view_bright_lite>
Use special colors for 'viewable' grids    [view_bright_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for non "viewable"
    grids in certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and
    "view_special_lite"). When this option is set, floor grids which
    are normally drawn in "white" but which are not currently
    "viewable" by the player are instead drawn in "dark gray". This
    makes the "viewable" grids to appear "brighter" than the others,
    allowing the player to easily determine which floor grids are in
    "line of sight". Turning this option off will probably increase the
    speed of the game.

***** <view_granite_lite>
Use special colors for wall grids (slow)    [view_granite_lite]
    This option activates a special color scheme for all "wall" grids
    which are normally drawn in "white" (as walls and rubble normally
    are). When the player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the
    grid is torch-lit, we use "yellow" (or "white") depending on the
    "view_yellow_lite" option, else if the "view_bright_lite" option
    is set, and the grid is not in line of sight, or the grid is dark,
    or the grid is only "partially" lit, then we use "gray", otherwise
    we use the normal "white". Turning this option off will probably
    increase the speed of the game.  This option may not work well if
    the attr/char codes for walls/veins have been changed.

***** <view_special_lite>
Use special colors for floor grids (slow)    [view_special_lite] 
    This option activates a special color scheme for all "floor" grids
    which are normally drawn in "white" (as they normally are). When
    the player is blind, we use "dark gray", else if the grid is
    torch-lit, we use "yellow" (or "white") depending on the
    "view_yellow_lite" option, else if the grid is "dark", we use
    "dark gray", else if the "view_bright_lite" option is set, and the
    grid is not in line of sight, we use "gray", otherwise we use the
    normal "white". Turning this option off will probably increase the
    speed of the game.  This option may not work well if the attr/char
    codes for walls/veins have been changed 

***** <view_perma_grids>
Map remembers all perma-lit grids    [view_perma_grids] 
    Memorize all perma-lit floor grids which are seen by the player.
    This option allows you to keep track of which explored floor grids
    were perma-lit, but does not distinguish between dark floor grids,
    unexplored floor grids, and unknown grids.  Turning off this option
    allows the player to always know which lit floor grids are in line
    of sight, but this is better accomplished by the "view_bright_lite"
    option.  Note that any non-floor grids which is seen by the player
    are always memorized, and "object" which is seen by the player is
    memorized independently from the memorization of the grid itself.

***** <view_torch_grids>
Map remembers all torch-lit grids    [view_torch_grids]
    Memorize all (torch-lit) floor grids which are seen by the player.
    This option not only allows you to keep track of which floor grids
    have been explored, but also which ones are "dark", because the use
    of this option activates a special "color scheme" for the display
    of floor grids, in which "dark" grids are drawn in "dark gray",
    "lit" grids are drawn in "white", and (if the "view_bright_lite"
    option is set) "lit" grids which are also in line of sight are
    drawn in "orange". Note that grids which are currently "torch-lit"
    are considered to be "lit", and are thus drawn in "white", unless
    the "view_yellow_lite" option is set, in which case they are drawn
    in "yellow".

***** <view_unsafe_grids>
Map marked by detect traps    [view_unsafe_grids]
    Unknown grids that have not been traversed previously, or had a
    detect trap spell cast on them are marked with a grey 'x'. This
    allows you to determine where in the dungeon you have cast detect
    traps, but does not ensure that grids not marked with a grey 'x'
    are trap free. This option has no effect on surface grids, but
    outdoor locations cannot be trapped.

***** <view_reduce_view>
Reduce view-radius in town    [view_reduce_view]
    Reduce the "radius" of the player's "view" by half when the player
    is in town.  This makes running faster in town, and also allows the
    player to ignore monsters in town which are more than ten grids
    away, which is usually safe, since none have distance attacks. 

***** <fresh_before>
Flush output while continuous command    [fresh_before]
    This option forces the game to flush all output before every
    command. This will give you maximal information, but may slow down
    the game somewhat. Note that this option is only useful when using
    macros, resting, running, or repeating commands, since the output
    is always flushed when the game is waiting for a keypress from the
    user.

***** <fresh_after>
Flush output after monster's move    [fresh_after]
    This option forces the game to flush all output after not only
    every player command, but also after every round of processing
    monsters and objects, which will give you maximal information, but
    may slow down the game a lot, especially on slower machines, and on
    faster machines you normally do not have a chance to see the
    results anyway.

***** <fresh_message>
Flush output after every message    [fresh_message]
    This option forces the game to flush all output after every message
    displayed by the game.  This will give you maximal information, but
    may slow down the game somewhat.

***** <hilite_player>
Hilite the player with the cursor    [hilite_player]
    Place the visible cursor on the player. This looks fine on some
    Unix machines, but horrible on most graphics machines. Note that
    only some machines are able to *not* show the cursor, but on those
    machines, hiding the cursor often speeds up the game and looks
    better.

***** <display_path>
Display actual path before shooting    [display_path]
    When this option is set, the targeting mode will show path from
    you to current target point continuously.


***** <TextDisplay>
=== Option set 3 -- Text Display ===

***** <plain_descriptions>
Plain object descriptions    [plain_descriptions]
    This option disables "full" names for identified 'flavored'
    objects, in other words, if this option is not in use, an
    identified Potion of Speed could be listed (for example) as a Blue
    Potion of Speed. If you prefer simpler, less verbose descriptions,
    set this option.

***** <always_show_list>
Always show list when choosing items    [always_show_list]
    When this option is set, all commands which lets you to choose an
    item from inventory or equipment list will automatically show list
    when activated.

***** <depth_in_feet>
Show dungeon level in feet    [depth_in_feet]
    Display the dungeon depth in "feet" instead of as an actual level.
    This also affects the monster memory display.

***** <show_labels>
Show labels in object listings    [show_labels]
    Display the "labels" for objects in the "equipment" list, and in
    any "special" window which is displaying the "equipment". These
    labels indicate what the player is "using" the object for, such as
    "wielding" or "wearing" (in a given location). After you have
    played for a while, this information is no longer useful, and can
    be annoying.

***** <show_weights>
Show weights in object listings    [show_weights]
    Display the weights of objects in the "inventory" and "equipment"
    lists, and in "stores", and in any "special" window which is
    displaying any of these lists.

***** <show_item_graph>
Show items graphics    [show_item_graph]
    Displays small icons of the items in your "inventory" list,
    "equipment" list and "stores".

***** <equippy_chars>
Display 'equippy' chars    [equippy_chars]
    This option will show you a graphical representation of your worn
    equipment on the main screen.  The 'equippy' chars will use the
    standard symbols of the respective items.

***** <display_mutations>
Display mutations in 'C'haracter Display    [display_mutations]
    Normally, if your character has gained mutations, they will be
    displayed in an extra 'h' mode window under the 'C'haracter
    Description command. Some players may wish to view mutations only
    via the knowledge command ('~' or '|') and do not want any extra
    screens in the Character Description: they should set this option.

***** <compress_savefile>
Compress messages in savefiles    [compress_savefile]
    Compress the savefile, by only saving the most recent "messages"
    that the player has received. This can cut the size of the savefile
    by a drastic amount, but will result in the loss of message
    information.

***** [b] tobjects_en.txt#Magic_weapon
***** <abbrev_extra>
Describe obj's extra resistances by abbreviation  [abbrev_extra]
    When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation
    string for the object's extra resitances and extra abilities are
    added as fake inscriptions of the object.

    A word "EXTRA" means that the ability must not be obvious from the
    objects name.  For example, a pair of boots of Levitation
    sometimes has EXTRA shard resistance.  But fire resistance of an
    armor of Resist Fire is not an EXTRA resistance.

    The list of abbreviations for each resistances and abilities are
    described in (tobjects_en.txt#Magic_weapon [b]).

***** <abbrev_all>
Describe obj's all resistances by abbreviation  [abbrev_all]
    When an *identified* equipment is displayed, an abbreviation
    string for all the object's resitances and abilities are added as
    fake inscriptions of the object. 

    The list of abbreviations for each resistances and abilities are
    described in (tobjects_en.txt#Magic_weapon [b]).

***** <exp_need>
Show the experience needed for the next level    [exp_need]
    Setting this option to yes alters the display of experience on the
    left of the main screen to the experience needed to reach the next
    character level, instead of the character's current total
    experience.

***** <ignore_unview>
Ignore whenever any monster performs an action  [ignore_unview]
    If this option is set, no messages will be displayed for monsters
    out of sight (that you, for example, have sensed through ESP)
    performing any actions. However, you still will have memory of those
    monster actions.

***** <refresh_mon_list>
Show offscreen monsters in visible monster list
    Keine - 'If you're using a subwindow to display detected monsters,
    if this option is set, detected monsters that are currently off
    screen will be listed there as well.'

***** <show_throwing_dam>
Show weapon throwing damage
    Keine - 'If this option is set, weapon throwing damage will be
    displayed after melee weapon's name in following format:
    (damage per throw/damage per round)'

***** <show_special_info>
Show other special item information
    Keine - 'This is a recently added option.
    If it is active, some special information will be shown.
    It's mostly for flavor only and isn't related to gameplay.
    Right now, it only displays monster names for newspaper articles
    you've read.'

***** <GamePlay>
=== Option set 4 -- Game playing ===

***** <stack_force_notes>
Merge inscriptions when stacking    [stack_force_notes]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if one has an
    empty inscription and the other does not. The resulting stack keeps
    the non-empty inscription.

***** <stack_force_costs>
Merge discounts when stacking    [stack_force_costs]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if they have
    different discounts. The resulting stack keeps the largest
    discount. This option may cause you to lose "value", but will give
    you optimal pack usage.

***** <expand_list>
Expand the power of the list commands    [expand_list]
    Expand the "listing" commands so that they "wrap" at the "edges" of
    the appropriate list.  This allows the "look" and "target" commands
    to "cycle" through all appropriate grids forever, and the "identify
    symbol" to browse through all of the monsters of a given type.

***** <small_levels>
Allow unusually small dungeon levels    [small_levels]
    This option enables the creation of levels of varying sizes. Levels
    that are as small as the town level (i.e. 1 'screen') are possible,
    yet they can be dangerous, especially for a low level character.
    Note that this option has the side effect of enabling / disabling
    'destroyed' levels (they are enabled if small levels are).

***** <always_small_levels>
Always create unusually small dungeon levels    [always_small_levels]
    If this option is enabled, then every level will be smaller than
    usual. See the 'Allow unusually small dungeon levels' option
    above.

***** <empty_levels>
Allow empty 'arena' levels    [empty_levels]
    Normal dungeon levels consist mostly of rock. If this option is in
    use, levels which have empty floor instead of solid rock may also 
    be created (somewhat reminiscent of Nethack's "big-room" levels). 
    These levels can be extremely deadly, especially with breathing
    monsters (since there are few obstructions to shield). Arena levels
    may have vaults, nests and pits in them like normal levels. Some
    arena levels are dark when they are created, but most are lit.

***** <bound_walls_perm>
Boundary walls become 'permanent wall'  [bound_walls_perm]
    If this option is set, boundaries of dungeon floors will
    explicitly look like permanent walls.  If unset, those will look
    like normal walls, but still behave as permanent walls.
    
***** <gun_free_world>
No guns are generated   [gun_free_world]
    If this option is set, "gun" kind weapons won't be usually generated.
    If you don't think guns suit Gensoukyou, or if you're playing a
    class that can't use guns and don't want more unusable items, set
    this option to on. This option has no effect on your score.

***** <always_check_arms>
Prompt for holding items in both hands   [always_check_arms]
    If this option is set, when you end up holding different items in
    both of your hands, you will be ask which one you want to swap out.

    For example, if you're holding only a bow and attempt to wield a
    sword, with this option off, you'll end up wielding both of those 
    items. However, if it is set to on, you will be prompted "Do you 
    want to put it in your free hand?". If you answer with 'n', you
    will unwield your bow, holding only the sword.

    Set this option to on if you want to fight while switching between
    ranged an melee weapons.   

***** <last_words>
Leave last words when your character dies    [last_words] 
    Lets you leave a last comment when you retire after winning or get
    a game over while trying.

***** <ex_attack_msg>
Change messages when attacking with weapons
    Usually, if you're attacking with a weapon, the message "You hit ###."
    will be displayed. If this option is set, then, depending on the
    weapon you're wielding, you might get various messages like
    "thrust", "slash", "strike". It's purely for flavor and does not
    affect gameplay.

***** <auto_dump>
Automatically generate character dump file name
    When you get a game over, retire, or abandon your quest, you'll be
    asked to enter a character dump file name. If you don't, no dump
    file will be generated; however, if this option is set, a file named
    'autodump_[player name].txt' will be automatically generated. You
    won't be able to progress until you make a successful character dump.

***** <allow_debug_opts>
Allow use of debug/cheat options  [allow_debug_opts]
    Since use of debug command(^A), wizard mode(^W), and Cheating
    options ('C' in options panel) mark the player as "Cheater" who
    can't register their score, these debug/cheat options are
    forbidden to use on default.  The allow_debug_opts option removes
    these restrictions, and allow the player to become "Cheater".


***** <Disturbance>
=== Option set 5 -- Disturbance ===

***** <find_ignore_stairs>
Run past stairs    [find_ignore_stairs]
    Ignore stairs when running.
    
***** <find_ignore_doors>
Run through open doors    [find_ignore_doors]
    Ignore open doors when running.

***** <find_cut>
Run past known corners    [find_cut]
    Cut sharply around "known" corners when running. This will result
    in "faster" running, but may cause you to run into a "lurking"
    monster.

***** <check_abort>
Check for user abort while continuous command    [check_abort]
    Avoid checking to see if the user has pressed a key during resting
    or running or repeated commands.  This not only makes the game much
    more efficient (on many systems), but also allows the use of
    certain obscure macro sequences, such as turning this option on,
    resting until done, turning this option off, and casting a spell.
    Note that the use of this option may be dangerous on certain
    "graphic" machines. Resting for long periods of time with this
    option set is dangerous since the resting may not stop until the
    user takes damage from starvation.

***** <flush_failure>
Flush input on various failures    [flush_failure]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever
    various "failures" occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure
    to use a wand, etc. This is very useful if you use macros which
    include "directional" components with commands that can fail, since
    it will prevent you from walking towards monsters when your spells
    fail.

***** <flush_disturb>
Flush input whenever disturbed    [flush_disturb]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever
    the character is "disturbed". This is useful if you use macros
    which take time, since it will prevent you from continuing your
    macro while being attacked by a monster.

***** <disturb_move>
Disturb whenever any monster moves    [disturb_move]
    Disturb the player when any monster moves, appears, or disappears.
    This includes monsters which are only visible due to telepathy, so
    you should probably turn this option off if you want to "rest" near
    such monsters.

***** <disturb_high>
Disturb whenever high-level monster moves    [disturb_high]
    Disturb the player when any monster whose level is higher than the
    player moves, appears, or disappears.  This includes monsters
    which are only visible due to telepathy.

    In Gensouband, this option applies to monsters whose level is unknown
    right now as well.    

***** <disturb_near>
Disturb whenever viewable monster moves    [disturb_near]
    Disturb the player when any viewable monster moves, whenever any
    monster becomes viewable for the first time, and also whenever any
    viewable monster becomes no longer viewable. This option ignores
    the existence of "telepathy" for the purpose of determining whether
    a monster is "viewable". See also the "view_reduce_view" option.

***** <disturb_pets>
Disturb when visible followers move    [disturb_pets]
    The player may wish that some of the disturbance options do not

used as the cut-off for using red to display both hitpoints and mana.


***** <Autosave>
=== Option A -- Autosave Options ===

Ideally, the game should be so stable that these options are not
needed at all. However, even if the game were 100% reliable (which it,
to be frank, probably is not), the user might forget to and his
hardware could fail him. For all of these reasons, you may want to use
these options:

***** <autosave_l>
Autosave when entering new levels    [autosave_l]
        If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your
        character every time before creating a new dungeon level.
        Useful if you experience hangups in level generation.

        If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your
        character every n game turns, where n is the "frequency".  To
        set frequency press n: it will increase the frequency to the
        next category (and from 25000 to 0), the categories being
        every 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000 and 25000
        turns. Note that the frequency must be higher than 0 and the
        "Timed autosave" set to "yes" for timed autosaves to take
        place.


***** <Window>
=== Option W - Window Flags ===

Keine - 'You can display up to 8 subwindows through Window -> Visibility
in the application menu bar.
You can display various useful information there, like your current
equipment, monster memory, list of monsters in sight. You can set flags
here to determine what kind of information you want displayed.
For example, if you want to display a list of items at your current location
in subwindow 3, press 'Y' at the '.' mark below 'Term-3' and to the right
of 'Display items at player location', changing the '.' mark to 'X'.
By the way, this function to display list of items beneath your feet is one
of the additions of this mod.'

***** <Cheating>
=== Option C - Cheating Options ===

Using the cheating options marks your character as "Cheater" and
you won't get into the high-score list.  Turning off the cheating
options later does NOT allow your character to get a highscore entry,
so think twice before using any cheat.

***** <cheat_peek>
Peek into object creation    [cheat_peek]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at object creation.

***** <cheat_hear>

***** <cheat_know>
Know complete monster info    [cheat_know]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can know all about monsters.

***** <cheat_live>
Allow player to avoid death    [cheat_live]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can cheat death.

***** <cheat_save>
Ask for saving death    [cheat_save]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can choose whether they save dead
    character data or not when they die. 


***** <Birth>
=== Birth options ===

The following options can make this game harder or easier. The birth
options can only be accessed while creating a new character (press '='
while creating the character). There is no way to turn them off after 
the creation is finished!

***** <ironman_shops>
Stores are permanently closed (*)    [ironman_shops]
    This option closes all shops. Try to survive in the deeps of
    the dungeon without supplies from town. Turning this option on
    raises your score.

***** <ironman_small_levels>
Always create unusually small dungeon levels (*)    [ironman_small_levels]
    If this option is enabled, then every level will be smaller than
    usual. See the 'Allow unusually small dungeon levels' option above.
    Turning this option on raises your score.

***** <ironman_empty_levels>
Always create empty 'arena' levels (*)    [ironman_empty_levels]
    If this option is enabled, then every level will be empty 'arena'
    level. See the "Allow empty 'arena' levels" option above. Turning
    this option on raises your score.

***** <ironman_no_fixed_art>
Don't generate fixed artifacts (*)   [ironman_no_fixed_art]
Keine - 'Prevents fixed artifacts from being generated. You'll have
         to cover your resistances with ego-items and randarts. It also
         makes randarts slightly more likely to be generated. Turning
         this option on slightly raises your score.'

***** <ironman_rooms>
Always generate very unusual rooms (*)    [ironman_rooms]
    If this option is enabled, every room becomes a vault. Turning
    this option on changes your score depending on difficulty level.

***** <no_capture_book>
Don't generate demon books (*)   [no_capture_book]
Keine - 'This is a new option for this mod. It prevents demon books - 
         reflavored capture balls - from being generated. Turning this
         option on slightly raises your score.'

***** <left_hander>
Left-Hander    [left_hander]
Keine - 'Enable this option if you're left-handed. You'll be usually
         holding your weapon with your left hand. Doesn't have any
         bonuses or penalties.'

***** <preserve_mode>
Preserve artifacts (*)    [preserve_mode]
    In non-preserve mode, once a fixed artifact is generated (either
    on the dungeon floor or in a monster drop), it will never be
    generated again during that game.  This means that if you miss the
    artifact by leaving the level before you pick it up it is gone
    forever. On the other hand, in preserve mode this behavior is only
    exhibited once you have identified the artifact. It is therefor
    safer to leave a level before it is completely explored as any
    fixed artifact can be regenerated in subsequent levels.

***** <powerup_home>
Increase capacity of your home (*)    [powerup_home]
    If this option is enabled, the capacity of your home will be expanded
    to 20 pages. If not, capacity is only 2 pages. Turning this option on
    lowers your score.

***** <birth_bonus_20>
***** <birth_bonus_10>
***** <ironman_no_bonus>
Fixed amount of bonus points (*)   [birth_bonus_20]
Low amount of bonus points (*)   [birth_bonus_10]
No bonus points (*)   [ironman_no_bonus]
Keine - 'This option affect character creation. When you start allocating
         bonus points, their amount will be 20 if it's 'fixed', and 10 if
         it's 'low'. If you're playing on Easy difficulty, it will be
         increased by 10.
         Playing with 20 bonus points increases your score by 5%.
         Playing with 10 bonus points increases your score by 20%.
         Playing with no bonus points increases your score by 50%.
         If you have several of those options set at the same time, the
         strictest one will be applied.'
