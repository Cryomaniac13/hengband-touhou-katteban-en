=== Dungeon Exploration ===

Keine - 'Let's review the basics about dungeons.
A dungeon is a multi-layered parallel world that completely changes its
layout when you enter it. Various items are strewn about, and wicked monsters
wander around.

You can move, attack, use items and perform other actions with various
commands. Enemies don't act until you perform an action, and there's no time
limit before you have to input a command; when you get in trouble, don't panic
and think carefully.

Raise your level by defeating enemies, build up your equipment by discovering
new items, and then go to the lowest level of the dungeon called Angband to
defeat the mastermind behind this incident.'

***** <Prepare>
=== Before Exploring the Dungeon ===

Keine - 'Now, I understand you eagerness,
but if you enter the dungeon without any preparations, you'll quickly get
lost and end up defeated. Here's some things you have to take with you in
early dungeon exploration:

- Food
  It can take several hours to several days to arrive at your destination.
  Unless you bring enough food with you, you might get a game over even
  before arriving at the dungeon.
  Rations of Food are sold at the General Store.
  Buy several if you need to visit a nearby dungeon; if you're a gluttonous
  race like an Oni, buy a lot. 
  Several races like Golems and Vampires don't get sustenance from eating
  normal food, so they need to use different means.

- Light Source
  There are illuminated rooms in the dungeon, but most of it is pitch black.
  It's dark to the point you can't see nearby enemies and can't read scrolls
  or spellbooks. In order to avoid that, bring torches or a lantern with you.
  Torches emit weak light and illuminate only your adjacent grids, so I
  recommend buying a lantern at General Store.
  Of course, don't forget about Flask of Oil for refueling.
  Vampires can see in darkness, so they don't need a light source.

- Equipment
  You start out with minimal equipment, but it's not much.
  In order to avoid getting defeated by dungeon monsters, let's prepare
  weapons and armor.

  Classes like warriors start the game out with a weapon, but depending
  on your class, you might start out only with a knife.
  Purchase a weapon in Weapon Store that matches your skill aptitude.
  I can't recommend short blades, since you can't held them in both of your
  hands, making it harder to get more attacks per round.

  Next, visit the Armoury and purchase items like headgear, boots or cloak.
  Having AC of around 20 should be enough for reaching dungeon level 10.
  However, don't just wear anything that looks sturdy - holding a shield
  makes you more likely to get less attacks per round, and spellcasters have
  harder time casting spells if they use heavy equipment.
  Your choice depends on various factors.

- Word of Recall
  Once you dive deep enough into the dungeon, going back will be difficult.
  If you read a Scroll of Word of Recall in the dungeon, you'll return
  straight to the surface. If you want to go back to dungeon from surface, you
  can read that scroll again or use Divine Spirit Mausoleum Branch Office.
  There's a delay before the recall takes place, so don't think of it as an
  emergency escape.

- Other
  Let's go over other useful tools in early game; you can buy them in town
  stores. You probably won't have enough money to buy all of them at first,
  so it's a good idea to keep accumulating money at early levels.
  If those items aren't being sold, if you wait for several in-game hours,
  the shop inventories will change.

  - Scrolls of Teleportation
    If you read it, you will teleport somewhere else on the level.
    You want to bring several of those with you in case you get surrounded
    by enemies.
  - Potions of Cure Serious Wounds
    Take around 10-20 with you and drink them if you don't have time to rest.
    Also, if you get confused or blinded, you can cure it by drinking those
    potions. There also are more powerful Potions of Cure Critical Wounds,
    but they're somewhat expensive.
  - Scrolls of Holy Chant
    If you read it, you become blessed for some time.
    While you are blessed, your AC and accuracy are increased, as well as
    your protection from magic.
    Reading one before fighting a strong enemy can make the fight easier.
  - Scrolls of Monster Confusion
    If you read it, your hands will start glowing.
    If you hit a monster in this state, you can confuse them.
    It's a useful item for fighting strong enemies in early game.
  - Staves/Scrolls of Object Detection
    It's tiresome to search each room one by one while you explore the
    dungeon. By using those items, you learn locations of nearby items.
  - Staves of Door/Stair Location, Scrolls of Magic Mapping, 
      Staves of Enlightenment
    By using those items, you can learn locations of nearby stairs or map out
    your surroundings. They're somewhat expensive, but you want to bring some
    with you once you go slightly deeper into the dungeon.
  - Ring of Warning.
    If you put it on your finger, it will vibrate once you're about to step on
    a trap or potentially get hit by a powerful enemy, warning you of danger.
    It's a useful item to avoid traps in early game.

Well, it's more or less like this. Of course, there's plenty of other useful
items available. Once you get past early game, look for items of Stone to Mud
and Teleport Away, and for some means of increasing speed and identifying
items. Once you reach midgame, you want some sources of double resistances,
powerful healing, emergency escape, Detection and *Destruction*.'

***** <MapSymbols>
=== Terrain Symbols (Detailed) ===

Keine - 'I've explained the meaning of symbols in town areas, but dungeons
have more various symbols, and some of them have different meaning.
Let's look over them in details.
By using '/' command, you can learn what a certain symbol means.

First of all, terrain.

  [[[[w|.| (Floor/road/sand/grassland)
  [[[[G|:| (Flowers/grass)
  Open ground.
  Some of them have different colors or names (grassland/sand), but they're
  essentialy the same.
  [[[[w|^| (Trap)
  A trap. You'll get harmed if you carelessly step on it.
  They're normally hidden and look just like open floor.
  You can locate traps using Trap Location or searching.
  You can attempt to disarm them, but disarming might fail.
  Items can't be dropped on top of traps.
  [[[[B|~| (Shallow water)
  Shallow body of water you can cross. Merfolk and kappas become more
  powerful in this terrain. Some monsters are aquatic and can't leave water.
  [[[[b|~| (Deep water)
  Deep body of water you have to swim across. Merfolk and kappas become more
  powerful in this terrain. If you enter this terrain when carrying enough
  weight, and you don't have either levitation or water resistance, you won't
  be able to swim and start drowning. While drowning, you act slower, and keep
  taking damage.
  It's particularly dangerous for vampires, who always will start drowning
  upon entering this terrain without levitation.
  Many monster can't swim, and they can't cross deep water.
  Items can't be dropped in deep water.
  [[[[U|~| (Shallow lava)
  Red-hot earth. You take fire damage just from walking across.
  [[[[r|~| (Deep lava) 
  Lava flow. If you enter it, you take a lot of damage.
  Even if you're levitating, you take some damage.
  Many monsters can't enter deep lava.
  Items can't be dropped in deep lava.
  [[[[D|#| (Dark pit) 
  A deep pit that has opened up in the ground. You can't go across unless
  you're levitating.
  Items can't be dropped in deep pits.
  [[[[U|'| (Open door) [[[[u|'| (Broken door)
  An open door you can go through.
  You can close doors that aren't broken down.
  Items can't be dropped on grids with non-broken doors.
  [[[[U|+| (Closed door)
  A closed door you can't go through.
  Some doors are hidden and looks just like walls.
  Some doors are locked, and can't be opened.
  You can attempt to unlock them.
  Doors also can be bashed down by brute force, but I don't recommend doing
  this unless you're strength enough.
  [[[[w|<| (Upward staircase) [[[[w|>| (Downward staircase)
  [[[[U|<| (Upward shaft)     [[[[U|>| (Downward shaft)
  Stairs. You can go to another level by pressing '<'/'>'.
  A staircase moves you 1 floor, a shaft move you 2 floors at once.
  Items can't be dropped on top of stairs.
  By the way, if you go to another level and then go back using the same
  staircase, for some reason, enemies will have their health fully recovered.
  [[[[G|#| Tree
  It's more of a forest than a single tree. You can't see past trees.
  It takes slightly more time to go through this terrain.
  (Walls)
  I can't show it here, but it looks like a white rectangle. That's the
  dungeon walls. Naturally, you can't go through them - unless you're a ghost
  or are using some wall-passing technique.
  If your digging skill is high enough, you can tunnel through walls. It takes
  some time. Quartz walls are easy to dig through, granite walls are sturdier.
  A spell or a magic device of Stone to Mud melts down any kind of wall in an
  instant. 
  There are permanent walls that are colored light brown; you can't destroy
  them in any manner, and you can't pass through them with any technique.
  [[[[o|*| (Treasure-containing vein)
  Basically same as a wall, except you find money if you dig through it.
  Many of them look like ordinary walls at first glance, but you can discover
  them using a Scroll of Treasure Detection.
  [[[[w|:| (Rubble)
  A pile of rubble. You can't go through, but you can easily dig it up.
  You might find some stones once you've tunneled through. They're an
  important food source if you're a golem.
  [[[[o|^| (Mountains)
  A massive wall. You can go across mountains on surface if you're levitating,
  but you can't go across mountains in dungeons at all.
  1~9 (Store)
  Some people set their stores up in the dungeon.
  You can buy and sell items here just like on surface.

  There are some other special kinds of terrain, but those are the ones you'll
  run into in most dungeons.'

***** <MonSymbols>
=== Monster Symbols ===

Keine - 'Monsters are mainly represented by letters of alphabet.
Some of them use other symbols, and there are also mimics that look just like
items. Be careful when approaching items lying on the ground.
You can check if the item in front of you is actually a monster by using
the 'l'ook command.

Here's a brief list. It'll be explored in more details in Monsters section.

                             is limited.
- (Wand/rod)                 Causes various effects if used. You can carry

As I said before, there are some monsters that look like items.
In particular, watch out for Death Swords that look like '|'.'

***** <Feelings>
=== Level Feeling ===

Keine - 'As you explore the dungeon, you might get a feeling about the
level you're currently on.

'What a boring place...'
'You feel your luck is turning...'
'You feel nervous.'
'You have a bad feeling...'
Do you know what affects this feeling?

That would be items and monsters that are unusually strong for current level.
If you explore a level where you feel danger, you might find plenty of
valuable items lying around... Or you might run into an enemy that's too
strong for you to handle.
Be more careful than usual when exploring those levels.
Don't hesitate to use frequently object/monster detection if you can.

The higher your Searching skill is, the faster you learn the level feeling.
Also, if you're Lucky or have a special option set to 'on',
you'll get different messages.'

***** <Vault>
=== Special Dungeon Locations ===

Keine - 'You might find some unusual locations in the dungeon.
Let's take a look at them.

- Pits/Nests
  A large rectangular room filled with monsters.
  All of them start out awake.
  I don't know what they're doing in a place like this, but they're going
  to attack you once you open the door.
  It has a specific shape; if you're careful, you'll notice it without
  going inside.

- Vaults
  Pretty much monster houses.
  They're filled with items, traps and monsters.
  Their layout can be complex; some of them are shaped like huge castles.
  Many of them are surrounded by indestructible permanent walls, and the
  monsters inside are clearly stronger than other monsters on current level.
  If you're an inexperienced adventurer, it might be better to stay away.

- Hordes
  It's not quite a 'location'; it's a swarm of awake monsters represented by
  the same symbol. Some of them might be strong for current dungeon level, so
  those are very dangerous.
  In particular, on lower dungeon levels, you might land in the middle of
  'D' or 'Z' monsters if you teleport around.

- Shopping District
  For some reason, you might find a town in the dungeon.
  Don't think about it too much. On lower levels, you'll be able to purchase
  better items.
  Even entering a shop counts as performing an action, so be careful.

- Pattern
  I don't know the details, but looks like it's a mechanism for some kind of
  trial. You can find it in some huge vaults.
  There's a road connecting the starting point and destination.
  Once you enter it, you can't leave it while you're going through.
  As you walk through it, your HP will keep decreasing.
  Looks like you can teleport to any dungeon level once you arrive at the
  destination. There's also high quality items around there.'

***** <RandomQuests>
=== Random Quests ===

Keine - 'At certain levels of Angband, you will encounter 'random quests'.
They're being guarded by an unique monster; if you defeat it, a staircase
to the next level will appear, along with several high quality items as your
reward.

You can escape if you're not able to defeat that monster.
After leaving the level and coming back, no quest will be issued, and stairs
to next level will appear as usual.'

--- Yukari Yakumo ---
Keine - 'Yukari Yakumo is at dungeon level 50 of Angband.
You have to fight and defeat her. She's a powerful opponent, but she still
has some weaknesses to exploit.
On Easy mode, defeating Yukari Yakumo counts as having cleared the game.
On Normal mode, you'll be marked as a ***WINNER*** at this point, and you
can retire at this point.'

***** <Dungeons>
=== Various Dungeons ===
Keine - 'There's plenty of various dungeons in Gensoukyou. Let's go over
them.

- Angband (Levels 1-100)
  The main dungeon of your quest.
  Your goal is to conquer it.
  It has standard monsters and terrain.
  Sometimes you can find valuable gemstones and ores here.

- Dreams Mausoleum (Levels 1-30)
  A dungeon located at Myouren Temple close to Human Village.
  It doesn't have special features like vault, and out-of-depth enemies
  don't spawn here.
  It's your training grounds for the start of your adventure.
  Sometimes you can find gemstones here.

- Forest of Magic (Levels 24-36)
  A dungeon deep inside Forest of Magic.
  Terrain is mostly forest, grasslands, swamps and rubble.
  You can frequently encounter beasts or mushroom monsters here, and you can
  gather plenty of mushrooms as well.
  The lowest level is guarded by a huge mushroom monster.

- Genbu Lake (Levels 10-20)
  Located between Forest of Magic and Youkai Mountain.
  Has walls full of holes and rivers.
  Many aquatic monsters are found here, along with some rare materials.

- Scarlet Devil Mansion (Levels 30-50)
  Located at the Scarlet Devil Mansion by the lake to north-north-east from
  the Human Village.
  Made of standard walls and floor terrain.
  Humanoids and demons are frequently found here, along with plenty of magic
  devices.
  The lowest level is guarded by the owner of Scarlet Devil Mansion.
  The chief maid is frequently found around the lowest levels, and she will 
  cut you down without asking any questions.
  Both of them are powerful opponents, so don't go too deep if you're not
  confident in your skills.

- Hell Valley (Levels 35-50)
  Located far to north-west from Human Village, close to Youkai Mountain.
  Full of rubble and pits; you'll have hard time exploring without levitation.
  Many ghost enemies can be found here.
  You can find valuable magical materials here.
  The lowest level is guarded by the underground hell raven.

- Muenzuka (Levels 40-50)
  Located very far to north-east from Human Village, beyond Youkai Mountain.
  Has open areas with plenty of forests and grasslands.
  Many various materials and high quality items can be found here, but there's
  also a lot of strong out-of-depth enemies starting out awake.

- Former Hell of Blazing Fires (Levels 40-50)
  First of all, go to the entrance to underground located very far away from
  Human Village in south-west area.
  Keep going through here and you'll reach Streets of Former Hell;
  the courtyard of Palace of Earth Spirits there has the entrance to this
  dungeon.
  It's full of lava. If you don't have levitation or other proper
  countermeasures, going in is suicidal.
  There's a lot of fire resistant or flying monsters in here.

- Inverted Castle (Levels 30-45)
  Located very far to north-west from the Human Village.
  An inverted castle floating in the sky that was directly related to a
  recent incident.
  Many corridors can be cut off by deep pits, so levitation is required.
  Also, magic is completely unusable here.

- Hermit Realm (Levels 30-45)
  Located very far to the west from Human Village.
  The recently resurrected saint made this location as training grounds
  for hermits.
  It's a curious place where all walls are made out of glass.
  For some reason, melee attacks are completely unusable here.

- Dragon Lair (Levels 60-72)
  Located even further in from the Streets of Former Hell in underground.
  It's a dangerous place with a lot of evil dragons from other worlds.
  There's a lot of deep pits here, so walking around without levitation
  will be diffuclt.
  You can find precious gemstones here, but be extremely careful when
  going deep in.

- Dream World (Levels 30-70)
  Located at a lake deep inside Youkai Mountain.
  This is the world you usually visit when you fall asleep, but looks you
  still can enter it in real world.
  Since everyone's already asleep, all monsters start out awake; on top of
  that, there's plenty of special features like vaults here. It's a very
  dangerous place.
  You can find some materials here you can't get other way, but you shouldn't
  go here unless you're confident enough in your skills.'

***** <Souvenir>
=== Souvenirs ===

Keine - 'As I explained, you can find so-called 'souvenirs' in each of the
dungeons. For example, you can find mushrooms in Forest of Magic, mercury and
arsenic in Hell Valley, or magic devices in Scarlet Devil Mansion.
You can find a wide variety of those in Muenzuka.
You'll find more 'souvenirs' the higher your Searching skill is.'
