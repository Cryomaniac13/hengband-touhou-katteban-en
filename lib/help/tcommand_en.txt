=== Commands Different from Original Hengband ===

Keine - 'For many people, it's most important to know differences in commands
compared to the original, so I'll start with that.

First of all, an important detail:
In this mod, class special abilities are used through 'J' command instead of
'm'. 'j' command lets you browse your class special abilities.
In roguelike layout, 'S' uses special abilities, 'P' browses them.

Also, 'b' command lets you browse not only spells, but also the special class
abilities from 'J' command and racial powers from 'U' command.

The 'jam a door' command was removed, along with iron spike items.

'x' key in original layout no longer opens command window; it's free to use
for macros.

Starting from version 1.1.27, spellcaster classes can use 'Barrier Guard' with
Ctrl-'g'. It's explained in more details in 'Other' section.'

***** <Turn>
=== Action Commands and Other Commands ===

Keine - 'There are two kinds of commands.
One of them involves you performs some action, and others let you look/examine
something or change options.

If you perform an action, you consume energy and let nearby monsters take a
turn; other commands don't consume energy.
You're free to look around, check your equipment or set options.'

***** <Keymapmode>
=== Keyboard Layout Modes ===

Keine - 'There are two modes for keyboard commands.

One of them is 'Original keyboard layout'.
It's easy to use since you move directly with arrow keys, but it's slightly
inefficient, since your right hand will move between arrow keys and letters.

Another of them is 'Roguelike keyboard layout'.
You use only normal keyboard, without arrow keys.
Directional movement resembles cursor movement in vi... do you understand
what I'm talking about?
It's somewhat difficult to grasp, but you'll be able to play on a laptop
without arrow keys, and your right hand will move more efficiently.

It's set to original layout by default.
This help file also starts by describing original layout commands.
You can change this setting through options command ('=').

***** <ComWindow>
=== Command Window ====

Keine - 'In Hengband, all actions are performed by entered commands with
keyboards. Total amount of commands is close to 100, which is probably a lot
for beginners.

However, don't worry! Try pressing the Enter key.
A command window resembling a certain JRPG will appear.
You'll be abel to find the command you need here.
Start off by using commands through this window, and remember them starting
from those you're using a lot.'

***** <SpecialKey>
=== Special Commands ===

Keine - 'Now, let's go over some special commands.

- Open command menu
  As I said before, use Enter key.

- Cancel
  If you decide against performing some action, press ESC key.

- Repeat previous command
  'n' key. Can be used in stores as well.

- Repeat a command several times
  Press '0' key, then enter amount of times you want to repeat, then enter the
  command you want to repeat.
  Commands like trap disarming or tunneling will be automatically repeated
  even without using this command.

- Control key
  Naturally, you can use Ctrl key along with another input, but depending on
  your environment and OS, it might not work properly.
  In this case, press '^' key; the key you enter next will be treated as if
  you pressed it with 'Ctrl'.

***** <Macro>
=== Macro Settings and Basic Examples ===

Keine - 'Now I'll explain about using macros.
Macros are a method of assigning different functions to a specified key.
You can perform macro-related command with '@'.

Macros can drastically increase effeciency of your exploration, but they
also involve concepts like special inscriptions, so they're very difficult
to understand for new players.
Here are some examples for ranged/spellcaster classes.
If you're a beginner, you probably shouldn't go deeper beyond that.

Let's start with ranged attack macro.
'@'->'4' (Record a macro) -> When asked for a key, input 'x' and wait for
around 1 second -> input '\e\e\ef1*t\e' -> '2' (Save macro to file)
Next, inscribe arrows you're carrying ('{' command) with '=g@f1'.
This makes you shoot at the monsters closest to you when you press 'x'; also,
you automatically pick up arrows you've shot.
You may use any key you like instead of 'x'; feel free to use on of those
that are marked (unused) in command lists above.
F1~F12 keys can be used as well.

Next up is spellcaster macro.

'@'->'4' (Record a macro) -> Input 'x' and wait for around 1 second -> input
'\e\e\emaa\e' -> '2' (Save macro to file)
Next, inscribe the spellbook you wish to use ('{' command) with '@ma'.
This makes you cast the first spell in that spellbooks when you press 'x'.
If it's an attack spell, input '\e\e\emaa*t\e' instead. It should cast that
spell at the monster closest to you. If you want to use the second spell,
replace 'maa' with 'mab'

The '\e' in macro strings represents ESC key.
You don't know what you could end up doing if you accidentally press the
macro key when the game isn't specifically waiting for a command input, so at
first is interrupts any other actions with repeating ESC keypresses.
You also can use '\r', representing 'return' (Enter) key.

If you want to know more details about macros, check out the help file for
user setting preferences.'
