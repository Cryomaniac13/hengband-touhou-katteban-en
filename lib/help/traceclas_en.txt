=== Races ===

Keine - 'Let's look over special characteristics of each race.
Feel free to skip parts that look too bothersome.
You might have fun looking at detailed information to create a powerful
character, or you might just create a character you like regardless
of their compatibility.

Hit Dice is related to HP calculation; base value is 10.
The higher your experience penalty is, the more slowly you gain levels.
Score modifier affects your score. The stronger you are, the lower it is.

Numbers in brackets after resistances/abilities/characteristics represent
the level at which you obtain it. If there's no numbers, you have this at
level 1.

Base value for magic realm aptitude is 5; there higher it is, the more
proficient you are. If it's 0, you can't study this realm at all.

Aptitudes are written in following order:

Elements/Divination/Enchantment/Summoning - 
Mysticism/Life/Exorcism/Nature - 
Transformation/Darkness/Necromancy/Chaos

Version 1.1.08 adds the Occult realm, but all races have standard aptitude
for it, so it's omitted.

If you're a beginner, I recommend picking a strong race disregarding
experience penalty.'

Resistances/abilities/characteristics:

Magic realm aptitude:
  5/5/5/5 - 5/5/5/5 - 5/5/5/5
Other:
  None

Keine - 'Ordinary humans without any special characteristics, except perhaps
levelling up quickly. Their physical stats are average, but they're weak
compared to many other non-human races. However, they don't have any weak
points in particular, and are capable of being any class.
Their fast growth might make playing a spellcaster easier. They're not bad
at being dual classes as well, but since they don't have innate resistances,
obtaining proper equipment might be difficult.
It's a familiar race that beginners frequently pick, but it's not that
suited for beginners.'

  33% vulnerablity to holy attacks
Magic realm aptitude:
  4/4/4/4 - 2/2/1/3 - 7/7/6/6
Other:
  None

Keine - 'There are many various kinds of youkai, but this category includes
comparatively ordinary-looking ones (like, for example, Rumia). Their physical
stats are clearly higher compared to humans, but they're not that smart.
However, they still might be decent at studying Sorcery Arts.
Also, youkai are generally vulnerable to holy attacks.'

Keine - 'Half human, half youkai, with stats somewhere in between.
They're surprisingly resilient to poisons, and they don't require much food.
They don't have any weak points in particular and are capable of being any

Other:
  Satiation level lowers very slowly
  Aggravates nearby shinigami
  Starting from level 20, will be attacked by assassins from hell

Keine - 'Hermits spend their days training secluded in the mountains. Their
physical stats by themselves aren't that high, but they also hold a bit of
mysterious power. They do fine as spellcasters, and their natural MP recovery
is a solid asset for dual classes.

The assassins from hell are mainly shinigami. The deeper down you go and
stronger you become, the more powerful assassins will come after you. If you
go around in the dungeon holding down keys, you might get surprise attacked
several times by one of them.
They have fairly large score and XP penalties.'

Othor
  AC bonus
  Aggravates nearby shinigami
  Starting from level 20, will be attacked by assassins from hell

Keine - 'More or less a stronger version of the already strong hermits.
You're not likely to have hard time in early game combat. You're strong, but
your penalties are severe at well. Suitable for beginners.
You're vulnerable to hellfire, but enemies that use it mainly appear on the
lower levels.'

Keine - 'Fairies appear all over Gensoukyou. What are they thinking, going
into a dangerous dungeon like that? They're probably not thinking at all.
They're extremely weak, and their score is doubled compared to humans. Pick
this race if you're confident in your skills and are looking for a challenge.'

Keine - 'Kappas are very dextrous. Usually they're not that strong, but they
become far more stronger in water. Aside from holy attacks, they're vulnerable
to lightning. They make good Engineers, but they're not bad as warriors
either'.

Other:
  Does not require food at all (but can overeat)

Keine - 'That's not a class, that's a race.
As their name implies, they specialize in magic.
They learn spells quickly and can efficiently use them. Since they have a
MP recovery power, they're suited for classes like Magic-Knight as well.
However, they're fairly weak physically, so keep an eye on your health.
They level up fairly quickly due to their curiousity, but their score is
lowered.'

Keine - 'Crow tengu, well known for their reputation-harming rumors.
They can move quite fast. They're also dextrous and smart, making them good
all around. However, they have to wear a tokin on their head. I don't know if
a policy or rule of theirs, but it can make you cry when you see an artifact
helmet. Has heavy penalties as well.'

Keine - 'White wolf tengu patrol the Youkai Mountain. They're good at
locating enemies and objects, and they're as good at close combat as they
look. However, they're bad at spellcasting. Just like crow tengu, they have

Magic realm aptitude:
  5/5/5/5 - 5/4/2/3 - 5/7/5/6
Other:
  Has large horns
  Satiation level decreases quickly
  Very hard to get drunk

Keine - 'The oni that keep crying children silent. They have astounding
strength and immense resilience. However, they're bad at more precise
actions, though their aptitude for spellcasting and magic devices isn't
that low. Naturally, they make excllent warriors, but any class can take
advantage of their resilience. High penalties, but probably the best at
early game combat. Suited for beginners.

Oni have splendid horns on their head.
They can use them to deliver powerful attacks during melee combat, but those
horns prevent them from wearing helmets.'

Other:
  Gets dice bonus when wielding scythes.

Keine - 'The grim reapers feared by everyone. Due to their reputation,
shopping in towns might be somewhat tough. They're a bit slow, but proficient
both at combat and spellcasting, and they are resilient and have various
resistances. A scythe is a weapon most appropriate for them.
They're protected against common sources of early game accidents - paralysis,
confusion, invisible monsters - which makes them suitable for beginners.
As subordinates of Yama, they're not vulnerable to holy attacks, which is also
a plus. They have fairly high penalties.'

Other:
  Speed +level/15
  During full moon night, +2 to all stats

Keine - 'Werebeasts have features of both humans and beasts. This category
includes both youkai beasts transformed into human shape and humans that
transform into a bestial form. They're nimble and tough, but they're not that
smart. They have useful abilities, and their penalties and restriction are
comparatively light.

Slightly meta statement:
In Gensoukyou, were-beasts and youkai beasts are very different, but they've
been unified for Gensouband.'

Other:

  Can prevent item curses from activating
  Reduces aggravation from equipment
  Cannot get wounded/diseased
  Eats magical energy from staves/wands instead of normal food

Keine - 'Tsukumogami are old and discarded tools that have obtained sentience.
Tools that are no longer usable should be properly memorialized to avoid
that. Since they were ordinary tools themselves, they're very good at using
items. There are many powerful items that aggravate monsters, which greatly
widens their equipment selection. Also, due to their unusual body structure
(even for a youkai), they can't be poisoned or wounded. However, their
physical stats are low.'

Other:
  Doesn't gain experience trhough combat; treats total value of equipment

  Cannot change race, and other races can't change into Youkai Dolls
  Cannot get wounded/diseased
  Eats magical energy from staves/wands instead of normal food
  (from v.1.66) Cannot get wounded/stunned, but can get 'broken'

Keine - 'Doll tsukumogami. It's a very special rate set apart from the others.
No matter how much you fight, you won't level up, but you can empower yourself
by becoming one with magical power of your equipment. Once you take off all
of your equipment, you will return to level 1.

If you get lucky and find a powerful item in early game, you'll be able to
quickly level up; however, at midgame, balancing your level, resistance and
parameters a the same time is going to be tough. In particular, dual classes
that rely on several stats will have a lot of trouble preparing their
equipment. Rings, amulets, and light sources don't affect your level.

Another meta statement: Of course, the youkai dolls in Gensoukyou don't work
like that. That's a feature taken from Hengband's Androids.'

Keine - 'Rabbits from the Moon. It's unclear what they're doing on Earth.
They resemble werebeasts, but they're not as proficient at combat. However,
with the training they've received, their skills like magic device use are
high. As citizens of the Moon devoid of impurity, they're not vulnerable to
holy energy. They're rarely being seen communicating with someone using
their large ears. They might be relying information they've collected back

Keine - 'Fox youkai. If you see two people with the same face getting
drunk at a banquest, one of them is a youkai fox. With their intelligence,
they're suited for spellcasting. Their physical stats aren't that low either,
and they have extremely sharp intuition.

If your first realm doesn't belong to Sorcery Arts, your vulnerability to
holy energy will go away as you accumulate enough experience. You'll become
a deified fox.
If you are studying Sorcery Arts as your first realm, your spell proficency
will rise faster.

fast rate. They're good at using magic devices as well, and will get a special
ability to recover MP as they level up. However, they're very bad at physical
combat. Always keep an eye on how much MP you have left.

Spellcasters have low HP, so they might get taken down pretty quickly upon
getting hit by an unresisted attack. If they get confused or blinded, they
can't read spellbooks and are unable to do anything. They attack enemies with
spells, which might end up completely ineffective depending on spell element
and enemy resistance. When facing a tough enemy, you might not be able to
finish them off even after you exhaust all of your MP. Therefore, spellcasters
have to be more careful picking their fights and developing tactics. If you're
not that familiar with elements and dangerous monsters, playing a spellcaster
will be tough. Once you obtain more powerful spells at midgame, you'll be
able to use far more various strategies.'

your deity likes blessed weapons, but dislikes edged weapons and cursed items.
If you study Sorcery Arts, it's the other way around - blessed items are
unsuitable for you. Any deity enjoys a lot when you offer them alcohol.

This class is capable of both close combat and spellcasting. Classes like
this are often called 'dual' or 'composite' classes. Dual classes might have
some trouble in early game - you have to focus on multiple stats, you gain
levels slowly, and you're not that strong in combat. In early game, it might
be a good idea to focus on your physical stats, relegating spellcasting to
support role. You're going to end up powerful if you reach endgame.'

armed warrior. They're not limited to punches and kicks, they can focus and
use powerful special abilities for ranged attacks or support.

However, they're lacking defense-wise.
Martial artists usually don't use weapons, and using shield or heavy armor
slows down their movement, reducing attack power. You'll have to cover your
resistances and raise parameters while keeping this limit in mind. On top of
that, they have surprisingly low HP for a close combat class.
They can stun enemies with martial art combat or avoid their special attacks,
but there's always an element of risk present. Like other close combat

  Always succeeds at activating the Gun 'Crimson'

Keine - 'Classified as a dual class, but has its own unique characteristics.
You can create machines at Engineer Guild in town, install those on your
backpack, and use them in combat. Machine attacks are very powerful, and you
can also make various excellent non-combat machines.

This is a powerful class, but it has its drawbacks. They're very bad at magic
device use and protection from magic, their machines might malfunction upon
getting hit by lightning or water, and most of all, creating machines and
obtaining ammo requires money. You'll probably want to use a crossbow or a
gun to deal with weaker enemies.'

Keine - 'A very unusual close combat class. They can fight in the dark
without requiring a light source. While in the dark, enemies are less likely
to notice them, allowing them to deliver devastating sneak attacks. Also,
when using martial art combat or short blades, they might occasionally hit
the enemy in a vital spot, dealing extreme damage in a single strike. This
strike multiplies total damage you deal, potentially letting you deal
absurd amounts of damage. If you can't find a good weapon, fighting with
martial arts works well, too. Your barehanded attacks are weak in early game,
but they're going to be stronger compared to weaker weapons by the endgame.

They're also good at throwing. If you buy a lot of daggers/knives in early
game, you'll be able to defeat most of the enemies from distance. If you
happen to find an excellent artifact suitable for throwing, you'll deal a lot
of damage.

While they have excellent resistances, their armor restrictions are very
severe, and their HP is low. Since you'll probably have to explore without
good defense, you have to be very careful and don't get into fights you can't
win.'
