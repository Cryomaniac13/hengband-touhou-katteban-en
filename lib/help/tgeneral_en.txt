=== What is Gensouband? ===

Keine - 'Gensouband is one of Japanese roguelike variants.

Do you know what a 'roguelike' is?
In 1980, the early days of computer games, there was a dungeon exploration RPG
called "Rogue". Dungeon exploration RPGs derived from this game are called
'roguelikes'. Their special characteristics are exploring randomly generated
dungeons, defeating enemies and collecting treasure; they're turn-based, and
the game ends when you are defeated.

A 'variant' is a derivative work.
Roguelikes have many various branches and variants. Gensouband belongs to the
following line:
"Rogue" -> "Moria" -> "Angband" -> "Zangband" -> "Hengband" -> "Gensouband".

Moria-Angband added a large amount of Tolkien-related content.

Zangband added a lot more content, including Cthulhu mythos and Chronicles
of Amber. Hengband added even more various content related to anime; while
the game ended up being very chaotic, the base gameplay system remains the
same.

Gensouband builds further upon it, adding material from Touhou Project.

Early roguelikes are simple games. Their graphical display is limited to 
symbols, there's no sound effects/BGM; the game world is created by the 
player's imagination - however, the very original roleplaying games
already were imaginary adventures.'

=== Hengband and Mods ===

Keine - 'Hengband's source code is freely available, and anyone can create
their own version by changing and re-compiling it. It's frequently called
a 'katteban'/'mod'/'personal version'.

Gensouband started out being titled as 'Hengband Katteban, with mainly
Touhou content being added', frequently shortened to 'Touhou Katteban'.
As more and more changes started piling up, its title was changed to avoid
confusion.

Some of you might want to make their own mod or a variant; in this case, I
strongly suggest starting with Hengband source code instead of Gensouband.

Current Hengband code is undergoing major refactoring, and it should be
far easier to work with compared to Gensouband code, which is a hobby
project based on 10 year old code.

For more details, check the official original Hengband website.'

=== Game Goal ===

Keine - 'Now, let's move on to Gensoukyou.
A suspicious cave has appeared to the west of Human Village, and violent
monsters are coming out of it. The goal of your adventure is to explore
that dungeon and resolve this incident.

At the start of your adventure, you might be weak to the point even a
stray dog can hurt you greatly. However, as you explore the dungeon, gain
experience, and obtain equipment, you'll be a match for many powerful
beings.'


***** <Gameover>
=== Game Over ===

Keine - 'I've said earlier that the game ends when you get defeated in as
roguelike; that's no exaggeration. The moment your HP drops below zero,
you lose all of your money, experience and items you've accumulated up to
this point, and have to restart the game from the beginning.
Several things remain, however - it's the monster memory you've built up
to this point, and your own personal experience as a player.
At first, you'll frequently get defeated over and over; however, if you
learn from your mistakes every time, eventually you're going to get defeated
only due to random chance.

...As an exception, Mokou still can go on even after getting defeated.
If you pick the Easy difficulty level, you can resurrect even without being
Mokou.'
