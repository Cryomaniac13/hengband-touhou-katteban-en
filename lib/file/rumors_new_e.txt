N:1:Human Village Rumors (basic)
Don't forget a light source before exploring dungeons.\It's better to buy a lantern and some oil instead of using torches.
Experienced adventurers start out by buying\Scrolls of Teleportation, Confuse Monster, healing potions,\some armor and a lantern.
I've occasionally seen people lying down in front of\the general store. When I try to talk to them, they reply\'I couldn't buy a lantern and lost interest in adventuring.'

N:2:Tengu Village Rumors (basic combat tactics, race/class)
The dungeon gets far deadlier from level 45.\Enemies beyond level 40 are in their own class of power.\You should train for a bit if you have less than 350 HP at that point.
Sometimes it's hard to get basic elements resistance.\You want to resist fire at level 20, acid/lightning/cold at level 30,\and poison at level 40.
When you go beyond level 40,\you'll start running into powerful enemies using high elements like\light, darkness, shards and nether.\You won't be able to resist all of them.\Remember which one of them uses what kind of attacks,\and avoid nasty enemies during exploration.
You can't move on since you don't have proper resistences?\It's fine! You can go pretty far if you're being careful!
Ah, the oni blacksmithes are so good at their job.\You won't find anyone like this on surface.
Several tengu came to explore that new cave, and they\came back with severe injuries.\It's simply massive, and it gets really dangerous as you go deep in.
There are beings who can grow in power depending on moon phase.\Vampires in particular are very strong under full moon.
Kappa machines are all waterproof and work well.\Other races have hard time matching them.
The engineers sure are a stingy bunch.\I guess that's what happens when you need money to properly do your job.
If you're fast, you might easily win if you fight back\as you're running away! Unless the enemy uses spells or something.
You can get double resistance to acid, lightning,\fire, cold and poison, greatly reducing the damage you take.\This is extremely important; remember it well.
There are monsters that can confuse you with their attacks.\If you're not resistant, you'll get beaten up.
If you get terrified,\you won't be able to attack enemies in melee,\and you'll be worse at shooting and spellcasting.
If you're blind, you can't read scrolls or spellbooks.\Your accuracy also suffers, so cure it as fast as you can.
Ghosts can pass through walls.\They can flee further in and recover as they fight enemies.
You want to face enemies one on one?\Dig a tunnel in a wall and wait there for the enemies to come.
White wolf tengu\are pretty good at surviving on their own.
Some fairy kids are getting interested in this incident\as well. I don't expect too much from them, though.
I've heard from shinigami\that there are assassins from hell hunting hermits\and celestials in the dungeon.
Crow tengu are strong, but they're not that suited for\dungeon exploration. They can fly across the surface\pretty fast, though.

Moon rabbits often look at the moon all alone while\muttering something. Who are they talking to?
I've heard there are youkai dolls that grow more powerful\depending on their equipment.
A tower has grown out of the bottom of valley a bit\earlier on. Some hermit with weird hair opened up a store there.\She's pretty brave to pull something like that at Youkai Mountain.
You can equip two shields at once.\It doesn't look pretty, but it might be useful.
Did you know Wands of Trap Destruction can destroy\secret doors as well?
Nameless youkai and fairies generally aren't that strong,\but you might get hit by painful danmaku if you're careless.
There's a technique called 'LoS trick'.\Explaining it would take too long, but, basically,\keep it in mind when using ranged combat or spells.
Kappas sometimes open a bazaar just across the waterfall.\They sell interesting machines, but I've heard they can\cause injury, so be careful.
There's a cave in Former Hell where oni dwell.\Sometimes a terrible roar can be heard around there.
You don't get much experience from defeating enemies on surface.
Stray gods can greatly power up if they gain fame.\You gain fame by defeating other well known powerful enemies.\If they're evil, your fame will go up even more.\On the other hand, gods that pick on weak humans are hated.
Sometimes potion merchants come to Hell Valley to gather\ingredients. That's certainly a job that requires patience.\Just how great are those potions they're making?
I've recently seen people using some unusual 'occult' spells.\However, our bookstore doesn't sell ridiculous books like this.
I've seen a haniwa get attacked by ghosts, but those attacks had\no effect at all. By the way, why are those haniwa moving?\Is this some new kind of golem?
A zashiki-warashi came to stay here a while ago.\I've heard they can't leave their household, but they\can move around if they dwell in some weird jar.\It was talking something about wanting a more powerful house.
There was some weird fellow who kept following me no matter\how many tornados I've launched at her. Apparently, that was\a danmakulogist looking for weak enemies that can cast tornados.\How rude!


N:3:Underground Town Rumors (midgame tactics)
Remember the number 533.\That's the maximum amount of damage you take if you get hit with\a basic element breath with only a single resistance.\That's a guideline for level 60.\I don't know what can happen on lower floors.
Light element attacks pass through glass walls.\Sometimes there are glass walls in dungeons,\so be careful if there are enemies that can breath light\or fire lasers on the other side.
Are you looking out for traps?\Deep underground, some of them are extremely dangerous.\Be careful.
What happens if your wall-walking spell runs out\while you're in a wall? Don't worry! You won't die right away!
I've heard there are some terrifying book monsters.
Disenchantment attacks degrade your equipment.\Even a legendary sword might end up turning dull.
Shard attacks cause wounds along with damage.\Which will cause even more damage.
If you get hit by chaos without resistance,\very bad things are going to happen.
Undead use nether attacks very well.\In addition to damage, it drains your life force.
People who fight while riding beasts are strong.\Their enemies have to split their attack between two targets.
People who can shoot fast are strong.\They leave less openings compared to fighting in melee.
Time attacks? Haven't heard of them.
Holy attacks? I don't want to hear of them.
If you're in a forest or in a wall, you take\half damage from breath attacks and explosive spells.
There are some horrible otherworldly monsters\that can make you go crazy if you look at them.\If you're already crazy, though, no need to worry.
A strange building came down from the ceiling\the other day, almost going through Palace of Earth Spirits.\It's some hermit's store.\Just what is she thinking...
If you have Scrolls of Teleport Level, you'll be\almost guaranteed to escape from trouble.\That is, if you can read it.
You absolutely have to be resistant to paralysis\at this point. Be careful not to lose your free action\as you change your equipment.
If you defeated an enemy, but there's no open space nearby,\all of their dropped item will disappear.\Keep that in mind if you're fighting in water or around traps.
Are you using the 'LoS trick'? It's useful, but don't\get overconfident. Powerful enemies might counterattack by calling for help.
Upon hearing about that weird cave popping up,\several of us went there to play and test their strength.\I've heard they couldn't find a staircase past midway\because that annoying person got in the way.
I was digging out a new tunnel, and a dragon suddenly came out.\That was just one of monsters from other world, but\it's still pretty strong.
People skilled with using shield can use them to slam enemies\while fighting, breaking their posture. Even a small trick like this\might come in handy when facing powerful opponents.
Be careful of hostile enemies summoned by traps\or your own failed summoning spells.\Unlike monsters summoned by other enemies, they might strike you right here and now.

[[] 'If you teleport because you're wounded, you might get\ attacked again at your destination if you're unlucky, so that's\ not a 100% safe escape method. \ Scrolls of Teleport Level or *Destruction* are more reliable.\ Of course, you also have to counteract paralysis, confusion and blindness.'

N:6:Kappa Village (early game strong enemies)
For fledgling adventurers, even crows and worm masses pose some danger.\But you should be fine, considering you've came here.
Have you heard about Death Swords?\It looks like an ordinary sword lying on the ground,\but it'll slash you when you approach it. You'll be able to notice it\if you're careful, so take a good look at swords lying around.
Have you heard about insects called hummerhorns?\They have confusion inducing poison and multiply quickly.\If you get surrounded by them, it's over.
There are few enemies with confusing attacks, but they're all dangerous.\Hummerhorns, umber hulks, pink horrors, daemonettes of Slaanesh...\One particularly dangerous is Nightmare.\Those appear deeper in the dungeon, but don't approach them unless\you're confusion resistant.
Have you heard of the tsuchigumo Yamame Kurodani?\She's a nasty enemy that can inflict poison, sickness and slowness.
Have you heard of one-eyed giants called cyclopses?\They're dangerously strong, and also are fast despite their size.\You'll get beat down if you're careless.
Bring a Staff of Probing with you if you can.\It can help you recognize which enemies are particularly dangerous.\However, as you go deeper, it's dangerous to spend your time while\there are awake enemies close by.
You probably won't be fully satisfied with your equipment at\dungeon level 20, but at very least try to cover fire resistance and free action.
Watch out for It.\No, I'm talking about a monster called 'It'. It's a weird invisible\being that's hard to notice even if you can see it.\If you're not a skilled adventurer, it's wise to escape once you see it.
Have you heard of the ghosts called Phantom beasts?\They're normally visible ghosts, but their bite hurts a lot.\I've heard of careless spellcasters getting defeated in a single blow.
There's a terrible beast called Gachapin.\It's dangerous. Very, very dangerous. Run away, run away!
Have you heard of weird strangers called nibelungs?\They're unpleasant fellows that like pickpocketing.\Their leaders have disenchantment attacks as well.\Don't get too close to them.
Have you heard of demons called Arch-viles?\They start pursuing you from afar, and keep throwing fireballs at\impressive speed. They're the reason you want fire resistance\at level 20.
Speaking of dark elves, their warlocks are more terrifying than\their lords. They cast mana bolts of unbelievable power. Not only\that, but sometimes they might quickly cast two in a row.\On top of all that, they appear in groups. Fortunately, they're frail,\so you can sneak up on them and take them out one by one.
Have you heard of an ogre called Grendel?\He moves fast and hits hard in close combat.\He's also surrounded by his minions - it's going to be a tough\battle even if you're confident in your skill.
Have you heard of weird dog-like monsters called hounds?\They stay in groups, keep their distance and hit you with\breath attacks, and then charge at you once you're weak enough.\You should dig a deep tunnel, lure them in and deal with them one by one.\Also, high level hounds are absurdly strong.
Have you heard of weird beings called disenchanter beasts?\They can disenchant items by touching them with their long trunk.\Artifacts aren't an exception.
Strong and fast enemies start appearing from around level 30.\You'll be at disadvantage unless you're hasted yourself. Anyone\can use Potions of Speed, but they're consumables, so try looking\for a Staff of Speed.\As for resistances, you have to cover base elements and free action;\confusion and fear resistance and see invisible are desirable as well.
There are powerful warrior from other worlds - black knights\and white knights. Physically they're as good as a well trained\human, but what's really dangerous about them is their spells.
Trolls aren't that tough despite their size,\but eldraks, war trolls and troll kings are dangerous enemies\you shouldn't get careless around.
Have you heard of weird people called logrus masters?\They're skilled at using chaos magic, if you get hit without chaos resistance,\very bad things will happen.
Have you heard of the puppeteer Alice Margatroid?\The dolls she summons are dangerous, so don't fight her in an open area.
Have you heard of the tengu Aya Shameimaru?\She chases after you, casting tornadoes, then takes your photo\and runs away. However, you won't get blown away by a tornado\if you're carrying a lot of items.
Have you heard of the oni Yuugi Hoshiguma?\It looks like she's playing around and holding back,\but she still might take you down in a single strike.
While fairies generally are common enemies, you should\be careful around EX fairies.
Have you heard of a book monster called\Raal's Tome of Destruction?\It looks like a book, but then it starts casting powerful spells.\Don't get careless.
Have you heard of monks?\They have different colors like ebony, topaz or jade, but all of them\are proficient in close combat.
Once you get past level 40, you'll meet strong enemies using\high elements like nether, shards or chaos. Avoid approaching them\without proper resistance. You'll have to remember what enemies\can use what kinds of attacks.
Have you heard of golems called drolems?\They're dragon-shaped golems that breathe really dangerous\poisonous gas. Nothing can save you if you don't have poison\resistance. And even that might not be enough...\Also, since they're golems, it's hard to detect them from distance,\and they're resistant to being teleported away.
Does it feel good to defeat weak dragons?\Dragons around level 40 are far stronger.\In particular, their breath attacks hit far harder.\If you want to fight them, bolster your defenses and be sure\to fight one on one. The rewards you get are also far greater.
Have you heard of the man called Jack of Shadows?\He moves incredibly fast and casts devastating darkness spells.\If you get close, he'll pick your pockets and run away,\but that might be the best outcome.
Have you heard of the dark elf Malekith?\He's unbelievably powerful for a dark elf.\And if you try to escape by teleporting, he'll follow after you!\Be prepared in case you run into him.
Hermits and large divine spirits occasionally appear in the dungeon.\Their spells are very dangerous to us.
Have you heard of Sakuya Izayoi?\She rarely leaves Scarlet Devil Mansion, but she's incredibly strong\for a human. She got me shredded before I knew what happened...
Have you heard of the shinigami Komachi Onozuka?\She has various nasty attacks like water, nether and holy energy.\On top of that, she resists being teleported away, and she will\pursue you if you try to escape by teleporting!\I don't think you can escape without *Destruction* or\Teleport Level.
Have you heard of the wanted youkai, Seija Kijin?\She's not that strong by herself, but she attacks using\powerful magic devices.
We don't know what's below level 50,\but according to rumors, the enemies there are even stronger than those\around level 40.\Oni sometimes buy Mega Crash from us.\Are those enemies really strong even for the oni...
Have you heard of huge reptiles called tyrannosauruses?\You might be done for if one of them bites you.
Hydras are stronger the more heads they have.\Nine- and eleven-headed hydras are nastier than some weaker dragons.
Have you heard of giants called greater titans?\They hit unbelievably hard.\On top of that, they can summon plenty of monsters. That's the kind of\enemy you don't want to fight no matter who you are.
Have you heard of undead called iron liches?\They look like huge skulls, but they powerfully breathe fire.\Their spells are strong as well.
Have you heard of weird enemies called color from outer space?\If terrain or items before you suddenly change colors, you've\encountered one of them. Avoid getting touched by them. Their breath\is powerful as well.
Have you heard of the giant Utgard-Loke?\He's a king of giants surrounded by his minions.\His cold breath is as powerful as that of a high level dragon.
Have you heard of the deity Quachil Uttaus?\...To be honest, I don't want to recall it.\Don't get too close. Don't even get in sight.
Have you heard of weird monsters called shoggoths?\It's a sticky mass that charges at you at tremendous speed and\hits hard with acid.\Unprotected armor will get destroyed in an instant.
Have you heard of a terrifying being called Yibb-Tstll?\It's an unmoving pitch-black giant.\Its breath attack is tremendously powerful.
Have you heard of a terrifying monster called Zhar?\It attacks with unbelievably destructive power.



N:9:Nazrin's advice (dungeon exploration)
You'll find plenty of various mushrooms early in the dungeon.\Most of them aren't useful, but if you gather enough,\you might exchange them a Kirisame Magic Shop for good items.
The first wall you might run into is level 20.\At that point, you need fire resistance, free action and\ability to see invisible. You can sense most of dangerous enemies at\levels 20-35 with Staff of Detect Chaotic.
At level 30-40 you'll start running into enemies you might be\unable to defeat in combat.\Don't be stubborn and run away. Your life is precious.\You'll be able to defeat them if you keep on training.
Beyond level 40, enemy attacks become far stronger than before.\It'd be wise to collect equipment and supplies at this point to raise\your own strength.
I've heard minor youkai have set up a mutual aid network to\exchange information and items. One of their branches is at the\back of the shrine. I can't participate because of my position, though.
Around level 30 it becomes important to detect enemies from afar.\I have good ears for this,\and several magic realms have spells for monster detection.\ \If you can't use spells or ears...\You'll have to find a rare Rod of Detection.
Are you visiting black markets?\They often sell powerful equipment and useful supplies.\It's very expensive, but check it out if you have the money.
Have you heard of 'double resistance'?\It applies to acid, lightning, fire, cold and poison attacks;\if you get resistance from a piece of equipment and then also gain\temporary resistance from a spell or a potion, you'll greatly\reduce the damage you're taking.\That's essential to know around level 40.
Weapon proficiency can be surprisingly important.\If you won't work on it, you won't be able to properly land a hit on powerful enemies.\Well, when our priest gets serious, she can land a hit even with\weapons she's not skilled with.
Around level 30 enemies that inflict hallucination will start appearing.\You can protect yourself with chaos resistance, but it's hard to obtain.\You have to use a Potion or Staff of Curing to heal hallucinations.
Equipment that grants telepathy is valuable.\You'll be able to sense most of the enemies from afar at all times,\making exploration far safer once you obtain it.
Be cautious around swords and cloaks lying around in the dungeon.\It might be a monster that looks just like an item.\You might get taken out in an instant if you're just starting out.\Be very careful.
A creepy cave has opened up to the west a while ago.\It's very deep, and I'm sensing something incredible residing in its depths.
There's a cave at the back of the temple.\It used to hold some nasty fellows sealed, but right now it's a hangout\for people with free time. It's also a good place to get some training.\You can find many gemstones in the depths.
Genbu Lake is around Forest of Magic and Youkai Mountain.\It occasionally has rare materials, and there aren't many powerful\enemies there, so that's a good location to explore.
Mushrooms grow very well in the Forest of Magic.\There's plenty of rare mushrooms deep inside, but watch out for magic\mushrooms that might attack you.
There's plenty of magic items deep in Scarlet Devil Mansion.\At the very end, valuable spellbooks can be easily found as well, but\the head maid is going to cut you up in an instant if she notices you.
Many rare items can be found at Muenzuka, so that's a good location\for treasure hunting. However, sometimes there are\nasty enemies walking around as well.
There's an underground tunnel that leads to the lair of a powerful\dragon from other world. There's also a lot of treasure...\Remember, your life is more precious.
Former Hell of Blazing Fires is a fitting name.\If you can't fly, going in is suicidal.\There's a lot of fire-breathing enemies and very little space to hide;\that's not a location I'd like to explore.
In the forest to south-west, there's a path leading to a hermit residence.\There's quite a lot of strong enemies there.\And for some reason, my physical attacks don't work there.
To the north-west there's an inverted castle floating in the sky.\It used to be a resistance base, but now it's a monster lair.\Looks like you can't cast spells in it for some reason.
You can find many golden nuggets and magic materials\in the Hell Valley. However, watch out for gasses and vengeful spirits.\It's a dangerous place.
There's a route to the Dream World around the lake of Youkai Mountain.\Those who sleep and see dreams enter this place, so everyone's awake\because they're sleeping in the first place.\As you go deeper inside, you can find many vaults there.\You can obtain some rare materials unavailable otherwise here, but it's\not a place for unskilled adventurers.
Sanzu River is to north-east of here.\Once you cross it, you'll be at the gates of Hell.\There's a lot of nasty monsters in Sanzu River, and they'll strike as soon as you enter it.\Don't approach it.
To the west of Tengu Village there's a place called False Heaven Shelf.\There's a youkai gambling den, a yamawaro hideout and a dangerous mineshaft there.\There's a new game involving ability cards in the gambling den,\but I don't recommend visiting it if you're not proficient enough.
You easily can get lost if you walk around the bamboo forest\near Eientei. You can avoid this if you're flying.
Are you worried about money?\The deeper you go in, the better items you will find, so quickly\diving might be a good item. If you're not confident in your skills,\you can dig up treasures on early levels with a digging implement and\Scrolls of Treasure Detection.
Hmm. Do you understand what you have to take with you\into the dungeon? Take plenty of Scrolls of Teleportation and\healing potions, 2-3 Scrolls of Word of Recall, and bring several\various staves of detection if you can.
You might get a disturbing feeling as you explore the dungeon.\That might there might be rare treasures or powerful monsters around.\Stay on your guard and explore.
Ordinary means of identification might not tell you all about\abilities of certain powerful items. There are several ways to perform\a more detailed *identification*, the easiest of them is visiting Kourindou.
Get equipment with resistances to protect yourself from enemy\special attacks. Finding equipment that both provides resistances and has\good stats is one of the pleasures of dungeon exploration.
You want to cover resistance to fire and free action by the\time you reach dungeon level 20. If possible, also cover resistance to\acid, cold, confusion, and get the ability to see invisible.
If you want to fight in close combat, aim for strength and\dexterity of at least 20; otherwise, you won't get many blows per round.
You can increase amount of blows in melee by holding your weapon\with both hands. If your strength is low, that might be better than\carrying a weapon and a shield.
Oni weapons are powerful, but they are very heavy.\If you can wield them properly, though, you'll get more critical hits\the heavier your weapon is.
Are you good at collection mushrooms and materials?\If your Searching skill is low, you'll have hard time finding those\special items in the dungeon.

N:7:Talking to Kaguya
Kaguya - 'How are you, hero? You've became really strong.\ \By the way, an otherworldly cave has appeared at the Moon as well.\The capital is about to be attacked by monsters and consumed by impurity.\Toyohime and Yorihime are doing their best, but it doesn't look good.\Could you help if you have the time?\I'll open a path leading to the Moon.'

N:10:Kirisame Magic Shop explanation
'Glad you asked. I'll explain how the Kirisame Magic Shop\works. First of all, you look for something valuable and bring it here.\I'd like something that can be used as magic material.\Spellbooks are fine too, but I want only the valuable ones.\Then, I'll appraise the item and give you corresponding amount of\MARIPO. It's short for 'Material Points'.\If you collect enough points, you can exchange them for a present.\The points are good for use until I die, so don't worry about it for now.'

                         NIGHTMARE DIARY\                          HOW TO USE IT\ \-If you read it, you'll get attacked by dream residents.\-If you are defeated in a nightmare, it's not a game over in real world.\-You don't get experience or items for defeating monsters in Nightmare World.\-You cannot perform destruction or distortion in Nightmare World.\-You cannot banish or charm monsters in Nightmare World.\-All beneficial effects are dispelled once you enter Nightmare World.\-Your allies are instantly banished from Nightmare World (aside from mounts)\-You can challenge new nightmare stages once you win enough times.\-Any consumables used in Nightmare World will stay used up once you return.\-You cannot fly in the Nightmare World.\-Since this is Dream World as well, I can show my true potential.

N:14:False Heaven Shelf Bar (changes in recent versions)
Did you know?\There's a cave connecting Forest of Magic and Capital of Former Hell.\It's far faster compared to going through that hole in south-west of Gensoukyou.
Humans that go into that mine-like place without oxygen run out of breath and collapse.\How can a human get inside?\Would something that lets you breathe underwater help in this case?
I saw a person holding a gun in each hand run up to an enemy and start brawling.\I thought he was crazy, but he was pretty strong.\You might be able to do something like that if you master both fireams and martial arts.
Have you heard about Geidontei bar in Human Village?\From midnight to dawn, it's exclusively for youkai.\If you visit them after hunting badgers or wild boars, they'll prepare you a delicious meal.
Have you heard about Hatate Himekaidou, the crow tengu?\She's a shut-in, but recently she has started a business tracking down people.\She lives at south-east in Tengu Village.
Have you seen those fishermen wandering in mountains?\They're probably uwabami in disguise.\If you mistake them for humans and try to mess with them, you'll get swallowed whole.
Behind Moriya Shrine, there's a youkai who governs over dreams.\If you look at her diary she's offering, you'll get sent to the Dream World\as a test subject for combination spellcards.
There was a skilled blacksmith karakasa-obake, but she's recently started haunting Hakurei Shrine.\Is that normal for a youkai?
I saw the Hakurei shrine maiden jump over Sanzu River, heading for the opposite shore.\I'm amazed she's not daunted by the dangerzone full of giant fish and sea dragons.
Don't carelessly eat whatever you find in the Forest of Magic.\Especially not the beans - they're not safe for youkai either.
There's a place spouting a pitch-black oil called 'petroleum'.\It burns spectacularly when you set it on fire;\it's fun to lure enemies into it and then attack with fire magic.
Got caught in a beartrap and can't move?\Don't panic and use a scroll of teleportation. You'll teleport by yourself, leaving the trap behind.
If you hit a block of ice with light magic, it will start to refract and cause a massive explosion.\You might get hurt as well.
If you resist confusion and deliberately trigger a confusion gas trap,\you can confuse nearby enemies.\How do you trigger a trap deliberately?\Not sure what's so hard to understand about it, you just step on it like when you go downstairs.
Did you know about the Grassroots Youkai Network group hanging out behind the shrine?\They run a screening process on potential new members.\If you're a human using transformation magic to look like a youkai,\they might find you intereseting and let you in.
The 'Barrier Guard' ability that spellcaster classes can use\gets more powerful if you have equipment that reduces spell costs or makes spellcasting easier.
If you throw a Potion of Berserk Strength at spellcaster enemies,\they might charge at you to beat you up instead of casting spells.
Lousy stat decreasing potions like 'Potion of Weakness'\can be thrown at monsters to weaken them.\Potions of Ruination are particularly powerful, and can be sold at a high price.
A proficient martial artist can stun enemies in melee, but a proficient staff wielder can do so as well.
A proficient martial artist can stun enemies in melee, and some unusual martial art styles can also slow enemies or reduce their abilities.
I saw a hermit standing on top of a flying dragon while fighting barehanded.\I wonder how much of a skilled rider you have to be to pull this off?
If you're a skilled at using shields, you might use it to bash your enemies as you fight them in melee.
Have you seen magical weapons that come back to you when thrown?\It requires a lot of skill to always catch one when it comes back.
A proficient short blade user can strike both fast and hard.
If you're not good with using weapons, go with long blades.\Even if you're not skilled, you will be able to handle it with enough training.
A katana master can slay even a massive beast with a single strike.
Don't underestimate a proficient staff wielder.\They can use their staff both for offense and defense, and if you let your guard down, they'll kick you hard.
A powerful axe blow cleaves through enemy armor and scaled, leaving their defense in tatters.
A skilled spear wielder can anticipate enemy attacks and deliver powerful counters.
A skilled bow user can quickly let loose many arrows.
Shards, disenchantment and mental attacks\not only deal damage, but also can weaken your enemies for a while.
Long ago, confusion and sleep were almost useless against named enemies,\but nowadays, they might be effective to some extent, depending on the enemy.\What do I mean by 'old days'? Old days is old days.
While in forest terrain, yamawaro move quicker than usual and are more powerful.\When they were kappa, they were stronger while in water, but they lost this ability.\To a casual observer, it might look like just a change of clothes, but that's how youkai are.
Ability cards?\There are some active traders around here.\They might give you something if you do them a favor.
You want a high rank ability card?\There's an ability card exchange venue open at night at Moriya Shrine.\There might be some generous people willing to give away high rank cards,\but be prepared to wait for months if you want to get the highest ranking ones.
Have you heard about drunken fist style?\I thought it was just a joke among drunkards,\but looks like when a proficient martial artist gets drunk, they can fight using drunken fist style.
I heard that the armoury in Former Hell is selling their brand of T-shirts.
